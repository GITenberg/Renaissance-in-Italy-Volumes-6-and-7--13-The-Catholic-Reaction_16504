    <h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>
    <p>At the end of the second volume of my 'Renaissance in Italy' I indulged the hope
    that I might live to describe the phase of culture which closed that brilliant epoch.
    It was in truth demanded that a work pretending to display the manifold activity of
    the Italian genius during the 15th century and the first quarter of the 16th, should
    also deal with the causes which interrupted its further development upon the same
    lines.</p>
    <p>This study, forming a logically-necessitated supplement to the five former volumes
    of 'Renaissance in Italy,' I have been permitted to complete. The results are now
    offered to the public in these two parts.</p>
    <p>So far as it was possible, I have conducted my treatment of the Catholic Revival
    on a method analogous to that adopted for the Renaissance. I found it, however,
    needful to enter more minutely into details regarding facts and institutions
    connected with the main theme of national culture.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Revival was by its nature reactionary. In order to explain its
    influences, I have been compelled to analyze the position of Spain in the Italian
    peninsula, the conduct of the Tridentine Council, the specific organization of the
    Holy Office and the Company of Jesus, and the state of society upon which those
    forces were brought to bear.</p>
    <p>In the list of books which follows these prefatory remarks, I have indicated the
    most important of the sources used by me. Special references will be made in their
    proper places to works of a subordinate value for the purposes of my inquiry.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In the first volume of my book on <i>Renaissance in Italy</i> I attempted to set
    forth the political and social <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"
    id="page2"></a>{2}</span> phases through which the Italians passed before their
    principal States fell into the hands of despots, and to explain the conditions of
    mutual jealousy and military feebleness which exposed those States to the assaults of
    foreign armies at the close of the fifteenth century.</p>
    <p>In the year 1494, when Charles VIII. of France, at Lodovico Sforza's invitation,
    crossed the Alps to make good his claim on Naples, the peninsula was Independent.
    Internal peace had prevailed for a period of nearly fifty years. An equilibrium had
    been established between the five great native Powers, which secured the advantages
    of confederation and diplomatic interaction.</p>
    <p>While using the word confederation, I do not, of course, imply that anything
    similar to the federal union of Switzerland or of North America existed in Italy. The
    contrary is proved by patent facts. On a miniature scale, Italy then displayed
    political conditions analogous to those which now prevail in Europe. The parcels of
    the nation adopted different forms of self-government, sought divers foreign
    alliances, and owed no allegiance to any central legislative or administrative body.
    I therefore speak of the Italian confederation only in the same sense as Europe may
    now be called a confederation of kindred races.</p>
    <p>In the year 1630, when Charles V. (of Austria and Spain) was crowned Emperor at
    Bologna, this national independence had been irretrievably lost <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>{3}</span> by the Italians. This
    confederation of evenly-balanced Powers was now exchanged for servitude beneath a
    foreign monarchy, and for subjection to a cosmopolitan elective priesthood.</p>
    <p>The history of social, intellectual, and moral conditions in Italy during the
    seventy years of the sixteenth century which followed Charles's coronation at
    Bologna, forms the subject of this work; but before entering upon these topics it
    will be well to devote one chapter to considering with due brevity the partition of
    Italy into five States in 1494, the dislocation of this order by the wars between
    Spain and France for supremacy, the position in which the same States found
    themselves respectively at the termination of those wars in 1527, and the new
    settlement of the peninsula effected by Charles V. in 1529-30.</p>
    <p>The five members of the Italian federation in 1494 were the kingdom of Naples, the
    Papacy, the Duchy of Milan, and the Republics of Venice and Florence. Round them, in
    various relations of amity or hostility, were grouped these minor Powers: the
    Republics of Genoa, Lucca, Siena; the Duchy of Ferrara, including Modena and Reggio;
    the Marquisates of Mantua and Montferrat; and the Duchy of Urbino. For our immediate
    purpose it is not worth taking separate account of the Republic of Pisa, which was
    practically though not thoroughly enslaved by Florence; or of the despots in the
    cities of Romagna, the March.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
    id="page4"></a>{4}</span> Umbria, and the Patrimony of S. Peter, who were being
    gradually absorbed into the Papal sovereignty. Nor need we at present notice Savoy,
    Piemonte, and Saluzzo. Although these north-western provinces were all-important
    through the period of Franco-Spanish wars, inasmuch as they opened the gate of Italy
    to French armies, and supplied those armies with a base for military operations, the
    Duchy of Savoy had not yet become an exclusively Italian Power.</p>
    <p>The kingdom of Naples, on the death of Alfonso the Magnanimous in 1458, had been
    separated from Sicily, and passed by testamentary appointment to his natural son
    Ferdinand. The bastard Aragonese dynasty was Italian in its tastes and interests,
    though unpopular both with the barons of the realm and with the people, who in their
    restlessness were ready to welcome any foreign deliverer from its oppressive yoke.
    This state of general discontent rendered the revival of the old Angevine party, and
    their resort to French aid, a source of peril to the monarchy. It also served as a
    convenient fulcrum for the ambitious schemes of conquest which the princes of the
    House of Aragon in Spain began to entertain. In territorial extent the kingdom of
    Naples was the most considerable parcel of the Italian community. It embraced the
    whole of Calabria, Apulia, the Abruzzi, and the Terra di Lavoro; marching on its
    northern boundary with the Papal States, and having no other neighbors.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span> But though so large and so
    compact a State, the semifeudal system of government which had obtained in Naples
    since the first conquest of the country by the Normans, the nature of its population,
    and the savage dynastic wars to which it had been constantly exposed, rendered it
    more backward in civilization than the northern and central provinces.</p>
    <p>The Papacy, after the ending of the schism and the settlement of Nicholas V. at
    Rome in 1447, gradually tended to become an Italian sovereignty. During the residence
    of the Popes at Avignon, and the weakness of the Papal See which followed in the
    period of the Councils (Pisa, Constance, and Basel), it had lost its hold not only on
    the immediate neighborhood of Rome, but also on its outlying possessions in Umbria,
    the Marches of Ancona, and the Exarchate of Ravenna. The great Houses of Colonna and
    Orsini asserted independence in their principalities. Bologna and Perugia pretended
    to republican government under the shadow of noble families; Bentivogli, Bracci,
    Baglioni. Imola, Faenza, Forl&igrave;, Rim&iacute;ni, Pesaro, Urbino, Camerino,
    Citt&agrave; di Castello, obeyed the rule of tyrants, who were practically lords of
    these cities though they bore the titles of Papal vicars, and who maintained
    themselves in wealth and power by exercising the profession of <i>condottieri</i>. It
    was the chief object of the Popes, after they were freed from the pressing perils of
    General Councils, and were once more settled in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
    id="page6"></a>{6}</span> their capital and recognized as sovereigns by the European
    Powers, to subdue their vassals and consolidate their provinces into a homogeneous
    kingdom. This plan was conceived and carried out by a succession of vigorous and
    unscrupulous Pontiffs&mdash;Sixtus IV., Alexander VI., Julius II., and Leo
    X.&mdash;throughout the period of distracting foreign wars which agitated Italy. They
    followed for the most part one line of policy, which was to place the wealth and
    authority of the Holy See at the disposal of their relatives, Riarios, Delia Roveres,
    Borgias, and Medici. Their military delegates, among whom the most efficient captain
    was the terrible Cesare Borgia, had full power to crush the liberties of cities,
    exterminate the dynasties of despots, and reduce refractory districts to the Papal
    sway. For these services they were rewarded with ducal and princely titles, with the
    administration of their conquests, and with the investiture of fiefs as vassals of
    the Church. The system had its obvious disadvantages. It tended to indecent nepotism;
    and as Pope succeeded Pope at intervals of a few years, each bent on aggrandizing his
    own family at the expense of those of his predecessors and the Church, the
    ecclesiastical States were kept in a continual ferment of expropriation and internal
    revolution. Yet it is difficult to conceive how a spiritual Power like the Papacy
    could have solved the problem set before it of becoming a substantial secular
    sovereignty, without recourse to this ruinous method. The Pope, a <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>{7}</span> lonely man upon an
    ill-established throne, surrounded by rivals whom his elevation had disappointed, was
    compelled to rely on the strong arm of adventurers with whose interests his own were
    indissolubly connected. The profits of all these schemes of egotistical rapacity
    eventually accrued, not to the relatives of the Pontiffs; none of whom, except the
    Delia Roveres in Urbino, founded a permanent dynasty at this period; but to the Holy
    See. Julius II., for example, on his election in 1503, entered into possession of all
    that Cesare Borgia had attempted to grasp for his own use. He found the Orsini and
    Colonna humbled, Romagna reduced to submission; and he carried on the policy of
    conquest by trampling out the liberties of Bologna and Perugia, recovering the cities
    held by Venice on the coast of Ravenna, and extending his sway over Emilia. The
    martial energy of Julius added Parma and Piacenza to the States of the Church, and
    detached Modena and Reggio from the Duchy of Ferrara. These new cities were gained by
    force; but Julius pretended that they formed part of the Exarchate of Ravenna, which
    had been granted to his predecessors by Pepin and Charles the Great. He pursued the
    Papal line of conquest in a nobler spirit than his predecessors, not seeking to
    advance his relatives so much as to reinstate the Church in her dominions. But he was
    reckless in the means employed to secure this object. Italy was devastated by wars
    stirred up, and by foreign armies introduced, in order that the<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>{8}</span> Pope might win a point in
    the great game of ecclesiastical aggrandizement. That his successor, Leo X., reverted
    to the former plan of carving principalities for his relatives out of the possessions
    of their neighbors and the Church, may be counted among the most important causes of
    the final ruin of Italian independence.</p>
    <p>Of the Duchy of Milan it is not necessary to speak at any great length, although
    the wars between France and Spain were chiefly carried on for its possession. It had
    been formed into a compact domain, of comparatively small extent, but of vast
    commercial and agricultural resources, by the two dynasties of Visconti and Sforza.
    In 1494 Lodovico Sforza, surnamed Il Moro, ruled Milan for his nephew, the titular
    Duke, whom he kept in gilded captivity, and whom he eventually murdered. In order to
    secure his usurped authority, this would-be Machiavelli thought it prudent to invite
    Charles VIII. into Italy. Charles was to assert his right to the throne of Naples.
    Lodovico was to be established in the Duchy of Milan. All his subsequent troubles
    arose from this transaction. Charles came, conquered, and returned to France,
    disturbing the political equilibrium of the Italian States, and founding a disastrous
    precedent for future foreign interference. His successor in the French kingdom, Louis
    XII., believed he had a title to the Duchy of Milan through his grandmother
    Valentina, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Visconti. The claim was not a <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span> legal one; for in the
    investiture of the Duchy females were excluded. It sufficed, however, to inflame the
    cupidity of Louis; and while he was still but Duke of Orleans, with no sure prospect
    of inheriting the crown of France, he seems to have indulged the fancy of annexing
    Milan. No sooner had he ascended the French throne than he began to act upon this
    ambition. He descended into Lombardy, overran the Milanese, sent Lodovico Sforza to
    die in a French prison, and initiated the duel between Spain and France for mastery,
    which ended with the capture of Francis I. at Pavia, and his final cession of all
    rights over Italy to Charles V. by the Treaty of Cambray.</p>
    <p>Of all the republics which had conferred luster upon Italy in its mediaeval period
    of prosperity Venice alone remained independent. She never submitted to a tyrant; and
    her government, though growing yearly more closely oligarchical, was acknowledged to
    be just and liberal. During the centuries of her greatest power Venice hardly ranked
    among Italian States. It had been her policy to confine herself to the lagoons and to
    the extension of her dominion over the Levant. In the fifteenth century, however,
    this policy was abandoned. Venice first possessed herself of Padua, by exterminating
    the despotic House of Carrara; next of Verona, by destroying the Scala dynasty.
    Subsequently, during the long dogeship of Francesco Foscari (1423-1457), she devoted
    herself in good <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span>
    earnest to the acquisition of territory upon the mainland. Then she entered as a
    Power of the first magnitude into the system of purely Italian politics. The Republic
    of S. Mark owned the sea coast of the Adriatic from Aquileia to the mouths of the Po;
    and her Lombard dependencies stretched as far as Bergamo westward. Her Italian
    neighbors were, therefore, the Duchy of Milan, the little Marquisate of Mantua, and
    the Duchy of Ferrara. When Constantinople fell in 1453, Venice was still more tempted
    to pursue this new policy of Italian aggrandizement. Meanwhile her growing empire
    seemed to menace the independence of less wealthy neighbors. The jealousy thus
    created and the cupidity which brought her into collision with Julius II. in 1508,
    exposed Venice to the crushing blow inflicted on her power by the combined forces of
    Europe in the war of the League of Cambray. From this blow, as well as from the
    simultaneous decline of their Oriental and Levantine commerce, the Venetians never
    recovered.</p>
    <p>When we turn to the Florentines, we find that at the same epoch, 1494, their
    ancient republican constitution had been fatally undermined by the advances of the
    family of Medici towards despotism. Lorenzo de'Medici, who enjoyed the credit of
    maintaining the equilibrium of Italy by wise diplomacy, had lately died. He left his
    son Piero, a hot-headed and rash young man, to control the affairs of the
    commonwealth, as he had previously controlled them, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> with a show of burgherlike equality, but
    with the reality of princely power. Another of his sons, Giovanni, received the honor
    of the Cardinalship. The one was destined to compromise the ascendency of his family
    in Florence for a period of eighteen years, the other was destined to re-establish
    that ascendency on a new and more despotic basis. Piero had not his father's
    prudence, and could not maintain himself in the delicate position of a commercial and
    civil tyrant. During the disturbances caused by the invasion of Charles VIII. he was
    driven with all his relatives into exile. The Medici were restored in 1512, after the
    battle of Ravenna, by Spanish troops, at the petition of the Cardinal Giovanni. The
    elevation of this man to the Papacy in 1513 enabled him to plant two of his nephews,
    as rulers, in Florence, and to pave the way whereby a third eventually rose to the
    dignity of the tiara. Clement VII. finally succeeded in rendering Florence subject to
    the Medici, by extinguishing the last sparks of republican opposition, and by so
    modifying the dynastic protectorate of his family that it was easily converted into a
    titular Grand Duchy.</p>
    <p>The federation of these five Powers had been artificially maintained during the
    half century of Italy's highest intellectual activity. That was the epoch when the
    Italians nearly attained to coherence as a nation, through common interests in art
    and humanism, and by the complicated machinery of diplomatic relations. The
    federation perished when <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
    id="page12"></a>{12}</span> foreign Powers chose Lombardy and Naples for their fields
    of battle. The disasters of the next thirty-three years (1494-1527) began in earnest
    on the day when Louis XII. claimed Milan and the Regno. He committed his first
    mistake by inviting Ferdinand the Catholic to share in the partition of Naples. That
    province was easily conquered; but Ferdinand retained the whole spoils for himself,
    securing a large Italian dependency and a magnificent basis of operations for the
    Spanish Crown. Then Louis made a second mistake by proposing to the visionary Emperor
    Maximilian that he should aid France in subjugating Venice. We have few instances on
    record of short-sighted diplomacy to match the Treaties of Granada and Blois (1501
    and 1504), through which this monarch, acting rather as a Duke of Milan than a King
    of France, complicated his Italian schemes by the introduction of two such dangerous
    allies as the Austrian Emperor and the Spanish sovereign, while the heir of both was
    in his cradle&mdash;that fatal child of fortune Charles.</p>
    <p>The stage of Italy was now prepared for a conflict which in no wise interested her
    prosperous cities and industrious population. Spain, France, Germany, with their
    Swiss auxiliaries, had been summoned upon various pretexts to partake of the rich
    prey she offered. Patriots like Machiavelli perceived too late the suicidal
    self-indulgence which, by substituting mercenary troops for national militia, and by
    accustoming selfish tyrants to rely on foreign <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
    id="page13"></a>{13}</span> aid, had exposed the Italians defenceless to the inroads
    of their warlike neighbors. Whatever parts the Powers of Italy might play, the game
    was really in the hands of French, Spanish, and German invaders. Meanwhile the mutual
    jealousies and hatreds of those Powers, kept in check by no tie stronger than
    diplomacy, prevented them from forming any scheme of common action. One great
    province (Naples) had fallen into Spanish hands; another (Milan) lay open through the
    passes of the Alps to France. The Papacy, in the center, manipulated these two
    hostile foreign forces with some advantage to itself, but with ever-deepening
    disaster for the race. As in the days of Guelf and Ghibelline, so now again the
    nation was bisected. The contest between French and Spanish factions became cruel.
    Personal interests were substituted for principles; cross-combinations perplexed the
    real issues of dispute; while one sole fact emerged into distinctness&mdash;that,
    whatever happened, Italy must be the spoil of the victorious duelist.</p>
    <p>The practical termination of this state of things arrived in the battle of Pavia,
    when Francis was removed as a prisoner to Madrid, and in the sack of Rome, when the
    Pope was imprisoned in the Castle of S. Angelo. It was then found that the laurels
    and the profit of the bloody contest remained with the King of Spain. What the people
    suffered from the marching and countermarching of armies, from the military
    occupations of towns, from the desolation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
    id="page14"></a>{14}</span> of rural districts, from ruinous campaigns and sanguinary
    battles, from the pillage of cities and the massacres of their inhabitants, can best
    be read in Burigozzo's <i>Chronicle of Milan</i>, in the details of the siege of
    Brescia and the destruction of Pavia, in the <i>Chronicle of Prato</i>, and in the
    several annals of the sack of Rome. The exhaustion of the country seemed complete;
    the spirit of the people was broken. But what soon afterwards became apparent, and
    what in 1527 might have been thought incredible, was that the single member of the
    Italian union which profited by these apocalyptic sufferings of the nation, was the
    Papacy. Clement VII., imprisoned in the Castle of S. Angelo, forced day and night to
    gaze upon his capital in flames and hear the groans of tortured Romans, emerged the
    only vigorous survivor of the five great Powers on whose concert Italian independence
    had been founded. Instead of being impaired, the position of the Papacy had been
    immeasurably improved. Owing to the prostration of Italy, there was now no resistance
    to the Pope's secular supremacy within the limits of his authorized dominion. The
    defeat of France and the accession of a Spanish monarch to the Empire guaranteed
    peace. No foreign force could levy armies or foment uprisings in the name of
    independence. Venice had been stunned and mutilated by the League of Cambray.
    Florence had been enslaved after the battle of Ravenna. Milan had been relinquished,
    out-worn, and depopu<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
    id="page15"></a>{15}</span> lated, to the nominal ascendency of an impotent Sforza.
    Naples was a province of the Spanish monarchy. The feudal vassals and the subject
    cities of the Holy See had been ground and churned together by a series of
    revolutions unexampled even in the mediaeval history of the Italian communes. If,
    therefore, the Pope could come to terms with the King of Spain for the partition of
    supreme authority in the peninsula, they might henceforward share the mangled remains
    of the Italian prey at peace together. This is precisely what they resolved on doing.
    The basis of their agreement was laid in the Treaty of Barcelona in 1529. It was
    ratified and secured by the Treaty of Cambray in the same year. By the former of
    these compacts Charles and Clement swore friendship. Clement promised the Imperial
    crown and the investiture of Naples to the King of Spain. Charles agreed to reinstate
    the Pope in Emilia, which had been seized from Ferrara by Julius II.; to procure the
    restoration of Ravenna and Cervia by the Venetians; to subdue Florence to the House
    of Medici; and to bestow the hand of his natural daughter Margaret of Austria on
    Clement's bastard nephew Alessandro, who was already designated ruler of the city. By
    the Treaty of Cambray Francis I. relinquished his claims on Italy and abandoned his
    Italian supporters without conditions, receiving in exchange the possession of
    Burgundy. The French allies who were sacrificed on this occasion by the Most
    Christian to the Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
    id="page16"></a>{16}</span> Catholic Monarch consisted of the Republics of Venice and
    Florence, the Dukes of Milan and Ferrara, the princely Houses of Orsini and Fregosi
    in Rome and Genoa, together with the Angevine nobles in the realm of Naples. The Paix
    des Dames, as this act of capitulation was called (since it had been drawn up in
    private conclave by Louise of Savoy and Margaret of Austria, the mother and the aunt
    of the two signatories), was a virtual acknowledgment of the fact that French
    influence in Italy was at an end.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
    <p>The surrender of Italy by Francis made it necessary that Charles V. should put in
    order the vast estates to which he now succeeded as sole master. He was, moreover,
    Emperor Elect; and he judged this occasion good for assuming the two crowns according
    to antique custom. Accordingly in July, 1529, he caused Andrea Doria to meet him at
    Barcelona, crossed the Mediterranean in a rough passage of fourteen days, landed at
    Genoa on August 12, and proceeded by Piacenza, Parma and Modena to Bologna, where
    Clement VII. was already awaiting him. The meeting of Charles and Clement at Bologna
    was so solemn an event in Italian history, and its results were so important for the
    several provinces of the peninsula, that I may be excused for enlarging at some
    length upon this episode.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
    id="page17"></a>{17}</span></p>
    <p>With pomp and pageantry it closed an age of unrivaled intellectual splendor and of
    unexampled sufferings through war. By diplomacy and debate it prescribed laws for a
    new age of unexpected ecclesiastical energy and of national peace procured at the
    price of slavery. Illustrious survivors from the period of the pagan Renaissance met
    here with young men destined to inaugurate the Catholic Revival. The compact struck
    between Emperor and Pope in private conferences, laid a basis for that firm alliance
    between Spain and Rome which seriously influenced the destinies of Europe. Finally,
    this was the last occasion upon which a modern Caesar received the iron and golden
    crowns in Italy from the hands of a Roman Pontiff. The fortunate inheritor of Spain,
    the Two Sicilies, Austria and the Low Countries, who then assumed them both at the
    age of twenty-nine, was not only the last who wielded the Imperial insignia with
    imperial authority, but was also a far more formidable potentate in Italy than any of
    his predecessors since Charles the Great had been.<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
    id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
    <p>That Charles should have employed the galleys of Doria for the transhipment of his
    person, suite, and military escort from Barcelona, deserves a word of comment. Andrea
    Doria had been bred in the service of the French crown, upon which Genoa was <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span> in his youth dependent.
    He formed a navy of decisive preponderance in the western Mediterranean, and in
    return for services rendered to Francis in the Neapolitan campaign of 1528, he
    demanded the liberation of his native city. When this was refused, Doria transferred
    his allegiance to the Spaniard, surprised Genoa and reinstated the republic,
    magnanimously refusing to secure its tyranny for himself or even to set the ducal cap
    upon his head. Charles invested him with the principality of Melfi and made him a
    Grandee of Spain. By this series of events Genoa was prepared to accept the yoke of
    Spanish influence and customs, which pressed so heavily in the succeeding century on
    Italy.</p>
    <p>Charles had a body of 2000 Spaniards already quartered at Genoa, as well as strong
    garrisons in the Milanese, and a force of about 7000 troops collected by the Prince
    of Orange from the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of the army which had plundered Rome. While
    he was on his road from Genoa to Bologna, this force was already moving upon
    Florence. He brought with him as escort some 10,000 men, counting horse and infantry.
    The total of the troops which obeyed his word in Italy might be computed at about
    27,000, including Spanish cavalry and foot-soldiers, German lansknechts and Italian
    mercenaries. This large army, partly stationed in important posts of defence, partly
    in movement, was sufficient to make every word of his a law. The French were in no
    position to interfere with his arrangements. His brother Ferdi<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span> nand, King of Bohemia
    and Hungary, was engaged in a doubtful contest with Soliman before the gates of
    Vienna. He was himself the most considerable potentate in Germany, then distracted by
    the struggles of the Reformation. Italy lay crushed and prostrate, trampled down by
    armies, exhausted by impost and exactions, terrorized by brutal violence. That
    Charles had come to speak his will and be obeyed was obvious.</p>
    <p>To greet the king on his arrival at Genoa, Clement deputed two ambassadors, the
    Cardinals Ercole Gonzaga and Monsignor Gianmatteo Giberti, Bishop of Verona. Gonzaga
    was destined to play a part of critical importance in the Tridentine Council. Giberti
    had made himself illustrious in the Church by the administration of his diocese on a
    system which anticipated the coming ecclesiastical reforms, and was already famous in
    the world of letters by his generous familiarity with students.<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
    id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Three other
    men of high distinction and of fateful future waited on their imperial master. Of
    these the first was Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, who succeeded Clement in the Papacy,
    opened the Tridentine Council, and added a new reigning family to the Italian
    princes. The others were the Pope's nephews, Alessandro de'Medici, Duke of Florence
    designate, and his cousin the Cardinal Ippolito de'Media. Six years later, Ippolito
    died at Itri, poisoned by his cousin Alessandro, who was himself <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span> murdered at Florence in
    1537 by another cousin, Lorenzino de'Medici.</p>
    <p>It had been intended that Charles should travel to Bologna from Parma through
    Mantua, where the Marquis Federigo Gonzaga had made great preparations for his
    reception. But the route by Reggio and Modena was more direct; and, yielding to the
    solicitations of Alfonso, Duke of Ferrara, he selected this instead. One of the
    stipulations of the Treaty of Barcelona, it will be remembered, had been that the
    Emperor should restore Emilia&mdash;that is to say, the cities and territories of
    Modena, Reggio, and Rubbiera&mdash;to the Papacy. Clement regarded Alfonso as a
    contumacious vassal, although his own right to that province only rested on the force
    of arms by which Julius II. had detached it from the Duchy of Ferrara. It was
    therefore somewhat difficult for Charles to accept the duke's hospitality. But when
    he had once done so, Alfonso knew how to ingratiate himself so well with the arbiter
    of Italy, that on taking leave of his guest upon the confines of Bologna, he had
    already secured the success of his own cause.</p>
    <p>Great preparations, meanwhile, were being made in Bologna. The misery and
    destitution of the country rendered money scarce, and cast a gloom over the people.
    It was noticed that when Clement entered the city on October 24, none of the common
    folk responded to the shouts of his attendants, <i>Viva Papa Clemente</i>! The Pope
    and his Court, too, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
    id="page21"></a>{21}</span> were in mourning. They had but recently escaped from the
    horrors of the Sack of Rome, and were under a vow to wear their beards unshorn in
    memory of their past sufferings. Yet the municipality and nobles of Bologna exerted
    their utmost in these bad times to render the reception of the Emperor worthy of the
    luster which his residence and coronation would confer upon them. Gallant guests
    began to flock into the city. Among these may be mentioned the brilliant Isabella
    d'Este, sister of Duke Alfonso, and mother of the reigning Marquis of Mantua. She
    arrived on November 1 with a glittering train of beautiful women, and took up her
    residence in the Palazzo Manzoli. Her quarters obtained no good fame in the following
    months; for the ladies of her suite were liberal of favors. Jousts, masquerades,
    street-brawls, and duels were of frequent occurrence beneath her
    windows&mdash;Spaniards and Italians disputing the honor of those light amours. On
    November 3 came Andrea Doria with his relative, the Cardinal Girolamo of that name.
    About the same time, Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggi, Bishop of Bologna, returned from his
    legation to England, where (as students of our history are well aware) he had been
    engaged upon the question of Henry VIII.'s divorce from Katharine of Aragon. Next day
    Charles arrived outside the gate, and took up his quarters in the rich convent of
    Certosa, which now forms the Campo Santo.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
    id="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>
    <p>He was surrounded by a multitude of ambassadors and delegates from the Bolognese
    magistracy, by Cardinals and ecclesiastics of all ranks, some of whom had attended
    him from the frontier, while others were drawn up to receive him. November 5 was a
    Friday, and this day was reckoned lucky by Charles. He therefore passed the night of
    the 4th at the Certosa, and on the following morning made his solemn entry into the
    city. A bodyguard of Germans, Burgundians, Spaniards, halberdiers, lansknechts, men
    at arms, and cannoneers, preceded him. High above these was borne the captain-general
    of the imperial force in Italy, the fierce and cruel Antonio de Leyva, under whose
    oppression Milan had been groaning. This ruthless tyrant was a martyr to gout and
    rheumatism. He could not ride or walk; and though he retained the whole vigor of his
    intellect and will, it was with difficulty that he moved his hands or head. He
    advanced in a litter of purple velvet, supported on the shoulders of his slaves.
    Among the splendid crowd of Spanish grandees who followed the troops, it is enough to
    mention the Grand Marshal, Don Alvaro Osorio, Marquis of Astorga, who carried a naked
    sword aloft. He was armed, on horseback; and his mantle of cloth of gold blazed with
    dolphins worked in pearls and precious stones. Next came Charles, mounted on a bay
    jennet, armed at all points, and holding in his hand the scepter. Twenty-four pages,
    chosen from the nobles of Bologna, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
    id="page23"></a>{23}</span> waited on his bridle and stirrups. The train was brought
    up by a multitude of secular and ecclesiastical princes too numerous to record in
    detail. Conspicuous among them for the historian were the Count of Nassau, Albert of
    Brandenburg, and the Marquis Bonifazio of Montferrat, the scion of the Eastern
    Paleologi. As this procession defiled through the streets of Bologna, it was remarked
    that Charles, with true Spanish haughtiness, made no response to the acclamations of
    the people, except once when, passing beneath a balcony of noble ladies, he
    acknowledged their salute by lifting the cap from his head.</p>
    <p>Clement, surrounded by a troop of prelates, was seated to receive him on a
    platform raised before the church of San Petronio in the great piazza. The king
    dismounted opposite the Papal throne, ascended the steps beneath his canopy of gold
    and crimson, and knelt to kiss the Pontiff's feet. When their eyes first met, it was
    observed that both turned pale; for the memory of outraged Rome was in the minds of
    both; and Caesar, while he paid this homage to Christ's Vicar, had the load of those
    long months of suffering and insult on his conscience. Clement bent down, and with
    streaming eyes saluted him upon the cheek. Then, when Charles was still upon his
    knees, they exchanged a few set words referring to the purpose of their meeting and
    their common desire for the pacification of Christendom. After this the Emperor elect
    rose, seated himself for a while <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
    id="page24"></a>{24}</span> beside the Pope, and next, at his invitation, escorted
    him to the great portal of the church. On the way, he inquired after Clement's
    health; to which the Pope replied somewhat significantly that, after leaving Rome, it
    had steadily improved. He tempered this allusion to his captivity, however, by adding
    that his eagerness to greet his Majesty had inspired him with more than wonted
    strength and courage. At the doorway they parted; and the Emperor, having paid his
    devotions to the Sacrament and kissed the altar, was conducted to the apartments
    prepared for him in the Palazzo Pubblico. These were adjacent to the Pope's lodgings
    in the same palace, and were so arranged that the two potentates could confer in
    private at all times. It is worthy of remark that the negotiations for the settlement
    of Italy which took place during the next six months in those rooms, were conducted
    personally by the high contracting parties, and that none of their deliberations
    transpired until the result of each was made public.</p>
    <p>The whole of November 5 had been occupied in these ceremonies. It was late evening
    when the Emperor gained his lodgings. The few next days were ostensibly occupied in
    receiving visitors. Among the first of these was the unfortunate ex-queen of Naples,
    Isabella, widow of Frederick of Aragon, the last king of the bastard dynasty founded
    by Alfonso. She was living in poverty at Ferrara, under the protection of her
    relatives, the Este family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
    id="page25"></a>{25}</span> On the 13th came the Prince of Orange and Don Ferrante
    Gonzaga, from the camp before Florence. The siege had begun, but had not yet been
    prosecuted with the strictest vigor. During the whole time of Charles's residence at
    Bologna, it must be borne in mind that the siege of Florence was being pressed.
    Superfluous troops detached from garrison duty in the Lombard towns were drafted
    across the hills to Tuscany. Whatever else the Emperor might decide for his Italian
    subjects, this at least was certain: Florence should be restored to the Medicean
    tyrants, as compensation to the Pope for Roman sufferings. The Prince of Orange came
    to explain the state of things at Florence, where government and people seemed
    prepared to resist to the death. Gonzaga had private business of his own to conduct,
    touching his engagement to the Pope's ward, Isabella, daughter and heiress of the
    wealthy Vespasiano Colonna.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, ambassadors from all the States and lordships of Italy flocked to
    Bologna. Great nobles from the South&mdash;Ascanio Colonna, Grand Constable of
    Naples; Alfonso d'Avalos, Marquis of Vasto; Giovanni Luigi Caraffa, Prince of
    Stigliano&mdash;took up their quarters in adjacent houses, or in the upper story of
    the Public Palace. The Marquis of Vasto arrests our graze for a moment. He was nephew
    to the Marquis of Pescara (husband of Vittoria Colonna), who had the glory of taking
    Francis prisoner at Pavia, and afterwards the infamy <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span> of betraying the unfortunate Girolamo
    Morone and his master the Duke of Milan to the resentment of the Spanish monarch.
    What part Pescara actually played in that dark passage of plot and counterplot
    remains obscure. But there is no doubt that he employed treachery, single if not
    double, for his own advantage. His arrogance and avowed hostility to the Italians
    caused his very name to be execrated; nor did his nephew, the Marquis of Vasto,
    differ in these respects from the more famous chief of his house. This man was also
    destined to obtain an evil reputation when he succeeded in 1532 to the government of
    Milan. Here too may be noticed the presence at Bologna of Girolamo Morone's son, who
    had been created Bishop of Modena in 1529. For him a remarkable fate was waiting.
    Condemned to the dungeons of the Inquisition as a heretic by Paul IV., rescued by
    Pius IV., and taken into highest favor at that Pontiff's Court, he successfully
    manipulated the closing of the Tridentine Council to the profit of the Papal See.</p>
    <p>Negotiations for the settlement of Italian affairs were proceeding without noise,
    but with continual progress, through this month. The lodgings of ambassadors and
    lords were so arranged in the Palazzo Pubblico that they, like their Imperial and
    Papal masters, could confer at all times and seasons. Every day brought some new
    illustrious visitor. On the 22nd arrived Federigo Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua, who
    took up his quarters in immediate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
    id="page27"></a>{27}</span> proximity to Charles and Clement. His business required
    but little management. The house of Gonzaga was already well affected to the Spanish
    cause, and counted several captains in the imperial army. Charles showed his favor by
    raising Mantua to the rank of a Duchy. It was different with the Republic of Venice
    and the Duke of Milan. The Emperor elect had reasons to be strongly prejudiced
    against them both&mdash;against Venice as the most formidable of the French allies in
    the last war; against Francesco Maria Sforza, as having been implicated, though
    obscurely, in Morone's conspiracy to drive the Spaniards from Italy and place the
    crown of Naples on Pescara's head. Clement took both under his protection. He had
    sufficient reasons to believe that the Venetians would purchase peace by the cession
    of their recent acquisitions on the Adriatic coast, and he knew that the pacification
    of Italy could not be accomplished without their aid. In effect, the Republic agreed
    to relinquish Cervia and Ravenna to the Pope, and their Apulian ports to Charles,
    engaging at the same time to pay a sum of 300,000 ducats and stipulating for an
    amnesty to all their agents and dependents. It is not so clear why Clement warmly
    espoused the cause of Sforza. That he did so is certain. He obtained a safe-conduct
    for the duke, and made it a point of personal favor that he should be received into
    the Emperor's grace. This stipulation appears to have been taken into account when
    the affairs of Fer<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span>
    rara were decided at a later date against the Papal interests.</p>
    <p>Francesco Maria Sforza appeared in Bologna on the 22nd. This unfortunate bearer of
    one of the most coveted titles in Europe had lately lived a prisoner in his own
    Castello, while the city at his doors and the fertile country round it were being
    subjected to cruelest outrage and oppression from Spanish, French, Swiss, and German
    mercenaries. He was a man ruined in health as well as fortune. Six years before this
    date, one of his chamberlains, Bonifazio Visconti, had given him a slight wound in
    the shoulder with a poisoned dagger. From this wound he never recovered; and it was
    pitiable to behold the broken man, unable to move or stand without support, dragging
    himself upon his knees to Caesar's footstool. Charles appears to have discerned that
    he had nothing to fear and much to gain, if he showed clemency to so powerless a
    suitor. Franceso was the last of his line. His health rendered it impossible that he
    should expect heirs; and although he subsequently married a princess of the House of
    Denmark, he died childless in the autumn of 1535. It was therefore determined, in
    compliance with the Pope's request, that Sforza should be confirmed in the Duchy of
    Milan. Pavia, however, was detached and given to the terrible Antonio de Leyva for
    his lifetime. The garrisons of Milan and Como were left in Spanish hands; and the
    duke promised to wring 400,000 <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
    id="page29"></a>{29}</span> ducats as the price of his investiture, with an
    additional sum of 500,000 ducats to be paid in ten yearly instalments, from his
    already blood-sucked people. It will be observed that money figured largely in all
    these high political transactions. Charles, though lord of many lands, was, even at
    this early stage of his career, distressed for want of cash. He rarely paid his
    troops, but commissioned the captains in his service to levy contributions on the
    provinces they occupied. The funds thus raised did not always reach the pockets of
    the soldiers, who subsisted as best they could by marauding. Having made these terms,
    Francesco Maria Sforza was received into the Imperial favor. He returned to Milan, in
    no sense less a prisoner than he had previously been, and with the heart-rending
    necessity of extorting money from his subjects at the point of Spanish swords. In
    exchange for the ducal title, he thus had made himself a tax-collector for his
    natural enemies. Secluded in the dreary chambers of his castle, assailed by the
    execrations of the Milanese, he may well have groaned, like Marlowe's
    Edward&mdash;</p>

    <p>When he died he bequeathed his duchy to the crown of Spain. It was detached from
    the Empire, and became the private property of Charles and of his son, Philip II.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>{30}</span> During the
    month of December negotiations for the terms of peace in Italy went briskly forward.
    On the part of Venice, two men of the highest distinction arrived as orators. These
    were Pietro Bembo and Gasparo Contarini, both of whom received the honors of the
    Cardinalate from Paul III. on his accession. Of Bembo's place in Italian society, as
    the dictator of literature at this epoch, I have already sufficiently spoken in
    another part of my work on the Renaissance. Contarini will more than once arrest our
    notice in the course of this volume. Of all the Italians of the time, he was perhaps
    the greatest, wisest, and most sympathetic. Had it been possible to avert the breach
    between Catholicism and Protestantism, to curb the intolerance of Inquisitors and the
    ambition of Jesuits, and to guide the reform of the Church by principles of
    moderation and liberal piety, Contarini was the man who might have restored unity to
    the Church in Europe. Once, indeed, at Regensburg in 1541, he seemed upon the very
    point of effecting a reconciliation between the parties that were tearing Christendom
    asunder. But his failure was even more conspicuous than his momentary semblance of
    success. It was not in the temper of the times to accept a Concordat founded on
    however philosophical, however politic, considerations. Contarini will be remembered
    as a 'beautiful soul,' born out of the due moment, and by no means adequate to cope
    with the fierce passions that raged round him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
    id="page31"></a>{31}</span> Among Protestants he was a Catholic, and they regarded
    his half measures with contempt. Among Catholics he passed for a suspected Lutheran,
    and his writings were only tolerated after they had been subjected to rigorous
    castration at the hands of Papal Inquisitors.<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
    id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
    <p>On Christmas eve the ambassadors and representatives of the Italian powers met
    together in the chambers of Cardinal Gattinara, Grand Chancellor of the Empire, to
    subscribe the terms of a confederation and perpetual league for the maintenance of
    peace. From this important document the Florentines were excluded, as open rebels to
    the will of Charles and Clement. There was no justice in the rigor with which
    Florence was now treated. Her republican independence had hitherto been recognized,
    although her own internal discords exposed her to a virtual despotism. But Clement
    stipulated and Charles conceded, as a <i>sine qua non</i> in the project of
    pacification, that Florence should be converted into a Medicean duchy. For the Duke
    of Ferrara, whom the Pope regarded as a contumacious vassal, and whose affairs were
    still the subject of debate, a place was specially reserved in the treaty. He, as I
    have already observed, had been taken under the Imperial protection; and a
    satisfactory settlement of his claims was now a mere question of time. On the evening
    of the same day, the Pope bestowed on Charles the Sword of the Spirit, which <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> it was the wont of Rome
    to confer on the best-beloved of her secular sons at this festival. The peace was
    publicly proclaimed, amid universal plaudits, on the last day of the year 1529.</p>
    <p>The chief affairs to be decided in the new year were the reduction of Florence to
    submission and the coronation of the Emperor. The month of January was passed in
    jousts and pastimes; ceremonial privileges were conferred on the University of
    Bologna; magnificent embassies from the Republic of S. Mark, glowing in senatorial
    robes of crimson silk, were entertained; and a singular deputation from the African
    court of Prester John obtained audience of the Roman Pontiff. Amid these festivities
    there arrived, on January 16, three delegates from Florence, who spent some weeks in
    fruitless efforts to obtain a hearing from the arbiters of Italy. Clement refused to
    deal with them, because their commonwealth was still refractory. Charles repelled
    them, because he wished to gratify the Pope, and knew that Florence remained staunch
    in her devotion to the French crown. The old proverb, 'Lilies with lilies,' the white
    lily of Florence united with the golden fleur-de-lys of France, had still political
    significance in this day of Italian degradation. Meanwhile Francis I. treated his
    faithful allies with lukewarm tolerance. The smaller fry of Italian potentates,
    worshipers of the rising sun of Spain, curried favor with their masters by insulting
    the republic's representatives. On their return to<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span> Florence, the ambassadors had to report a
    total diplomatic failure. But this, far from breaking the untamable spirit of the
    Signory and people, prompted them in February to new efforts of resistance and to
    edicts of outlawry against citizens whom they regarded as traitors to the State.
    Among the proscribed were Francesco Guicciardini, Roberto Acciaiuoli, Francesco
    Vettori, and Baccio Valori. Of these men Francesco Guicciardini, Francesco Vettori,
    and Baccio Valori were attendant at Bologna upon the Pope. They all adhered with
    fidelity to the Medicean party at this crisis of their country's fate, and all paid
    dearly for their loyalty. When Cosimo I., by their efforts, was established in the
    duchy, he made it one of his first cares to rid himself of these too faithful
    servants. Baccio Valori was beheaded after the battle of Montemurlo in 1537 for
    practice with the exiles of Filippo Strozzi's party. Francesco Guicciardini,
    Francesco Vettori, and Roberto Acciaiuoli died in disgrace before the year
    1543&mdash;their only crime being that they had made themselves the ladder whereby a
    Medici had climbed into his throne, and which it was his business to upset when
    firmly seated. For the heroism of Florence at this moment it would be difficult to
    find fit words of panegyric. The republic stood alone, abandoned by France to the hot
    rage of Clement and the cold contempt of Charles, deserted by the powers of Italy,
    betrayed by lying captains, deluged on all sides with the scum of armies pouring
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span> into Tuscany from
    the Lombard pandemonium of war. The situation was one of impracticable difficulty.
    Florence could not but fall. Yet every generous heart will throb with sympathy while
    reading the story of that final stand for independence, in which a handful of
    burghers persisted, though congregated princes licked the dust from feet of Emperor
    and Pontiff.</p>
    <p>Charles had come to assume the iron and the golden crowns in Italy. He ought to
    have journeyed to Monza or to S. Ambrogio at Milan for the first, and to the Lateran
    in Rome for the second of these investitures. An Emperor of the Swabian House would
    have been compelled by precedent and superstition to observe this form. It is true
    that the coronation of a German prince as the successor of Lombard kings and Roman
    Augusti, had always been a symbolic ceremony rather than a rite which ratified
    genuine Imperial authority. Still the ceremony connoted many mediaeval aspirations.
    It was the outward sign of theories that had once exerted an ideal influence. To
    dissociate the two-fold sacrament from Milan and from Rome was the same as robbing it
    of its main virtue, the virtue of a mystical conception. It was tantamount to a
    demonstration that the belief in Universal Monarchy had passed away. By breaking the
    old rules of his investiture, Charles notified the disappearance of the mediaeval
    order, and proclaimed new political ideals to the world. When asked whether he would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>{35}</span> not follow custom
    and seek the Lombard crown in Monza, he brutally replied that he was not wont to run
    after crowns, but to have crowns running after him. He trampled no less on that still
    more venerable <i>religio loci</i> which attached imperial rights to Rome. Together
    with this ancient piety, he swept the Holy Roman Empire into the dust-heap of archaic
    curiosities. By declaring his will to be crowned where he chose, he emphasized the
    modern state motto of <i>L'&eacute;tat, c'est moi</i>, and prepared the way for a
    Pope's closing of a General Council by the word <i>L'Eglise, c'est moi</i>. Charles
    had sufficient reasons for acting as he did. The Holy Roman Empire ever since the
    first event of Charles the Great's coronation, when it justified itself as a
    diplomatical expedient for unifying Western Christendom, had existed more or less as
    a shadow. Charles violated the duties which alone gave the semblance of a substance
    to that shadow. As King of Italy, he had desolated the Lombard realm of which he
    sought the title. As Emperor elect, he had ravished his bride, the Eternal City. As
    suitor to the Pope for both of his expected crowns, he stood responsible for the
    multiplied insults to which Clement had been so recently exposed. No Emperor had been
    more powerful since Charles the Great than this Charles V., the last who took his
    crowns in Italy. It was significant that he man in whose name Rome had suffered
    outrage, and who was about to detach Lombardy from the Empire, was by his own will
    invested at Bologna.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
    id="page36"></a>{36}</span> The citizens of Monza were accordingly bidden to send the
    iron crown to Bologna. It arrived on February 20, and on the 22nd Charles received it
    from the hands of Clement in the chapel of the palace. The Cardinal who performed the
    ceremony of unction was a Fleming, William Hencheneor, who in the Sack of Rome had
    bought his freedom for the large sum of 40,000 crowns. On this auspicious occasion he
    cut off half the beard which he still wore in sign of mourning!</p>
    <p>The Duke and Duchess of Urbino made their entrance into Bologna on the same day.
    Francesco Maria della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, Prefect of Rome, and Captain General of
    the armies of the Church, was one of the most noted warriors of that time. Yet
    victory had rarely crowned his brows with laurels. Imitating the cautious tactics of
    Braccio, and emulating the fame of Fabius Cunctator, he reduced the art of war to a
    system of manoeuvres, and rarely risked his fortune in the field. It was chiefly due
    to his dilatory movements that the disaster of the Sack of Rome was not averted. He
    had been expelled by Leo X. from his duchy to make room for Lorenzo de'Medici, and
    report ran that a secret desire to witness the humiliation of a Medicean Pontiff
    caused him to withhold his forces from attacking the tumultuary troops of Bourbon.
    Francesco Maria was a man of violent temper; nineteen years before, he had murdered
    the Pope's Legate, Cardinal Francesco Alidosi, with his dagger, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>{37}</span> in the open streets of
    Bologna. His wife, Eleanora Ippolita Gonzaga, presided with grace over that brilliant
    and cultivated Court which Castiglione made famous by his <i>Cortegiano</i>. The Duke
    and Duchess survive to posterity in two masterpieces of portraiture by the hand of
    Titian which now adorn the Gallery of the Uffizzi.</p>
    <p>February 24, which was the anniversary of Charles's birthday, had been fixed for
    his coronation as Emperor in San Petronio. This church is one of the largest Gothic
    buildings in Italy. Its fa&ccedil;ade occupies the southern side of the piazza. The
    western side, on the left of the church, is taken up by the Palazzo Pubblico. In
    order to facilitate the passage of the Pope and Emperor with their Courts and train
    of princes from the palace to the cathedral, a wooden bridge wide enough to take six
    men abreast was constructed from an opening in the Hall of the Ancients. The bridge
    descended by a gradual line to the piazza, broadened out into a platform before the
    front of San Petronio, and then again ascended through the nave to the high altar. It
    was covered with blue draperies, and so arranged that the vast multitudes assembled
    in the square and church to see the ceremony had free access to it on all sides. On
    the morning of the 24th, the solemn procession issued from the palace, and defiled in
    order down the gangway. Clement was borne aloft by Pontifical grooms in their red
    liveries. He wore the tiara and a cope of state <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page38" id="page38"></a>{38}</span> fastened by Cellini's famous stud, in which
    blazed the Burgundian diamond of Charles the Bold. Charles walked in royal robes
    attended by the Count of Nassau and Don Pietro di Toledo, the Viceroy of Naples, who
    afterwards gave his name to the chief street in that city. Before him went the
    Marquis of Montferrat, bearing the scepter; Philip, Duke of Bavaria, carrying the
    golden orb; the Duke of Urbino, with the sword; and the Duke of Savoy, holding the
    imperial diadem. This Duke of Savoy was uncle to Francis I. and brother-in-law to
    Charles&mdash;- his wife, Beatrice, being a sister of the Empress, and his sister,
    Louise, mother of the French king. This double relationship made his position during
    the late wars a difficult one. Yet his territory had been regarded as neutral, and in
    the pacification of Italy he judged it wise to adhere without reserve to the
    victorious King of Spain. It was noticed that Ferrante di Sanseverino, Prince of
    Salerno, though known to be in Bologna, occupied no post of distinction in the
    imperial train. He was closely related to the Emperor by his mother, Maria of Aragon,
    and had done good service in the recent campaigns against Lautrec. The reason for
    this neglect does not appear. But it may be mentioned that some years later he
    espoused the French cause, and was deprived of his vast hereditary fiefs. In his ruin
    the poet Bernardo, father of Torquato Tasso, was involved.</p>
    <p>To enumerate all the nobles of Spain, Italy and<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span> Germany, with the ambassadors from England,
    France, Scotland, Hungary, Bohemia and Portugal; who swelled the Imperial
    <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>; to describe the series of ceremonies by which Charles was
    first consecrated as a deacon, anointed, dressed and undressed, and finally conducted
    to the Pope for coronation; to narrate the breaking of the bridge at one point, and
    the squabbles between the Genoese and Sienese delegates for precedence, would be
    superfluously tedious. The day was well-nigh over when at length Charles received the
    Imperial insignia from the Pope's hands. <i>Accipe gladium sanctum, Accipe virgam,
    Accipe pomum, Accipe signum gloriae</i>! As Clement pronounced these sentences, he
    gave the sword, the scepter, the globe, and the diadem in succession to the Emperor,
    who knelt before him. Charles bent and kissed the Papal feet. He then rose and took
    his throne beside the Pope. It was placed two steps lower than that of Clement. The
    ceremony of coronation and enthronization being now complete, Charles was proclaimed:
    <i>Romanorum Imperator semper augustus, mundi totius Dominus, universis Dominis,
    universis Principibus et Populis semper venerandus</i>. When Mass was over, Pope and
    Emperor shook hands. At the church-door, Charles held Clement's stirrup, and when the
    Pope had mounted, he led his palfrey for some paces, in sign of filial
    submission.</p>
    <p>The month of March was distinguished by the arrival of illustrious visitors. The
    Duchess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span> Savoy,
    with an escort of eighteen lovely maids of honor, made her pompous entry on the 4th,
    and took up her quarters in the Palazzo Pepoli. On the 6th came the Duke of Ferrara,
    for whom Charles had procured a safe-conduct from the Pope. During the Emperor's stay
    at Bologna, Alfonso d'Este had been assiduous in paying him and his Court small
    attentions, sending excellent provisions for the household and furnishing the royal
    table with game and every kind of delicacy. The settlement of his dispute with the
    Holy See was the only important business that remained to be transacted. Charles
    prevailed upon both Clement and Alfonso to state their cases in writing and to place
    them in the hands of jurisconsults, to report upon. There is little doubt that his
    own mind was already made up in favor of the duke; but he did not pass sentence until
    the following December, nor was the decision published before April in the year 1531.
    The substance of the final agreement was as follows. Modena, Reggio and Rubbiera were
    declared fiefs of the Empire, seeing that they had not been included in Pepin's gift
    of the Exarchate. Charles confirmed their investiture to Alfonso, in return for a
    considerable payment to the Imperial Chancery. He had previously conferred the town
    of Carpi, forfeited by Alberto Pio as a French adherent, on the Duke. Ferrara
    remained a fief of the Church, and Clement consented to acknowledge Alfonso's tenure,
    upon his disbursement of 100,000 ducats. This decision saved Modena to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span> the bastard line of
    Este, when Pope Clement VIII. seized Ferrara as a lapsed fief in 1598. In the
    sixty-seven years which passed between the date of Charles's coronation and the
    extinction of the duchy, Ferrara enjoyed the fame of the most brilliant Court in
    Italy, and shone with the luster conferred on it by men like Tasso and Guarini.</p>
    <p>The few weeks which now remained before Charles left Bologna were spent for the
    most part in jousts and tournaments, visits to churches, and social entertainments.
    Veronica Gambara threw her apartments open to the numerous men of letters who crowded
    from all parts of Italy to witness the ceremony, of Charles's coronation. This lady
    was widow to the late lord of Correggio, and one of the two most illustrious women of
    her time.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
    class="fnanchor">[5]</a> She dwelt with princely state in a palace of the Marsili;
    and here might be seen the poets Bembo, Mauro, and Molza in conversation with witty
    Berni, learned Vida, stately Trissino, and noble-hearted Marcantonio Flaminio. Paolo
    Giovio and Francesco Guicciardini, the chief historians of their time, were also to
    be found there, together with a host of literary and diplomatic worthies attached to
    the Courts of Urbino and Ferrara or attendant on the train of cardinals, who, like
    Ippolito de'Medici, made a display of culture. Meanwhile the Dowager-Marchioness of
    Mantua and the Duchess of Savoy entertained Italian and Spanish nobles with masqued
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span> balls and carnival
    processions in the Manzoli and Pepoli palaces. Frequent quarrels between hot-blooded
    youths of the rival nations added a spice of chivalrous romance to love-adventures in
    which the ladies of these Courts played a too conspicuous part. What still remained
    to Italy of Renaissance splendor, wit, and fashion, after the Sack of Rome and the
    prostration of her wealthiest cities, was concentrated in this sunset blaze of
    sumptuous festivity at Bologna. Nor were the arts without illustrious
    representatives. Francesco Mazzola, surnamed Il Parmigianino, before whose
    altar-piece in his Roman studio the rough soldiers of Bourbon's army were said to
    have lately knelt in adoration, commemorated the hero of the day by painting Charles
    attended by Fame who crowned his forehead, and an infant Hercules who handed him the
    globe. Titian, too, was there, and received the honor of several sittings from the
    Emperor. His life-sized portrait of Charles in full armor, seated on a white
    war-horse, has perished. But it gave such satisfaction at the moment that the
    fortunate master was created knight and count palatine, and appointed painter to the
    Emperor with a fixed pension. Titian also painted portraits of Antonio de Leyva and
    Alfonso d'Avalos, but whether upon this occasion or in 1532, when he was again
    summoned to the Imperial Court at Bologna, is not certain. From this assemblage of
    eminent personages we notice the absence of Pietro Aretino. He was at the moment out
    of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span> favor with
    Clement VII. But independently of this obstacle, he may well have thought it
    imprudent to quit his Venetian retreat and expose himself to the resentment of so
    many princes whom he had alternately loaded with false praises and bemired with
    loathsome libels.</p>
    <p>People observed that the Emperor in his excursions through the streets of Bologna
    usually wore the Spanish habit. He was dressed in black velvet, with black silk
    stockings, black shoes, and a black velvet cap adorned with black feathers. This
    somber costume received some relief from jewels used for buttons; and the collar of
    the Golden Fleece shone upon the monarch's breast. So slight a circumstance would
    scarcely deserve attention, were it not that in a short space of time it became the
    fashion throughout Italy to adopt the subdued tone of Spanish clothing. The upper
    classes consented to exchange the varied and brilliant dresses which gave gayety to
    the earlier Renaissance for the dismal severity conspicuous in Morone's masterpieces,
    in the magnificent gloom of the Genoese Brignoli, and in the portraits of Roman
    inquisitors. It is as though the whole race had put on mourning for its loss of
    liberty, its servitude to foreign tyrants and ecclesiastical hypocrites. Nor is it
    fanciful to detect a note of moral sadness and mental depression corresponding to
    these black garments in the faces of that later generation. How different is Tasso's
    melancholy grace from Ariosto's gentle joyousness; <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span> the dried-up precision of Baroccio's
    Francesco Maria della Rovere from the sanguine joviality of Titian's first duke of
    that name! One of the most acutely critical of contemporary poets felt the change
    which I have indicated, and ascribed it to the same cause. Campanella wrote as
    follows:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Black robes befit our age. Once they were white;<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">Next many-hued; now dark as Afric's Moor,<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In the midst of this mirth-making there arrived on March 20 an embassy from
    England, announcing Henry VIII.'s resolve to divorce himself at any cost from
    Katharine of Aragon. This may well have recalled both Pope and Emperor to a sense of
    the gravity of European affairs. The schism of England was now imminent. Germany was
    distracted by Protestant revolution. The armies of Caesar were largely composed of
    mutinous Lutherans. Some of these soldiers had even dared to overthrow a colossal
    statue of Clement VII. and grind it into powder at Bologna; and this outrage, as it
    appears, went unpunished. The very troops employed in reducing rebellious Florence
    were commanded by a Lutheran general; and Clement began to fear that, after Charles's
    departure, the Prince of Orange might cross the Apennines and expose the Papal person
    to the insults of another captivity in Bologna. Nor <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span> were the gathering forces of revolutionary
    Protestants alone ominous. Though Soliman had been repulsed before Vienna, the Turks
    were still advancing on the eastern borders of the Empire. Their fleets swept the
    Levantine waters, while the pirate dynasties of Tunis and Algiers threatened the
    whole Mediterranean coast with ruin. Charles, still uncertain what part he should
    take in the disputes of Germany, left Bologna for the Tyrol on March 23. Clement, on
    the last day of the month, took his journey by Loreto to Rome.</p>
    <p>It will be useful, at this point, to recapitulate the net results of Charles's
    administration of Italian affairs in 1530. The kingdom of the Two Sicilies, with the
    Island of Sardinia and the Duchy of Milan, became Spanish provinces, and were ruled
    henceforth by viceroys. The House of Este was confirmed in the Duchy of Ferrara,
    including Modena and Reggio. The Duchies of Savoy and Mantua and the Marquisate of
    Montferrat, which had espoused the Spanish cause, were undisturbed. Genoa and Siena,
    both of them avowed allies of Spain, the former under Spanish protection, the latter
    subject to Spanish coercion, remained with the name and empty privileges of
    republics. Venice had made her peace with Spain, and though she was still strong
    enough to pursue an independent policy, she showed as yet no inclination, and had,
    indeed, no power, to stir up enemies against the Spanish autocrat. The Duchy of
    Urbino, recog<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span> nized
    by Rome and subservient to Spanish influence, was permitted to exist. The Papacy once
    more assumed a haughty tone, relying on the firm alliance struck with Spain. This
    league, as years went by, was destined to grow still closer, still more fruitful of
    results.</p>
    <p>Florence alone had been excepted from the articles of peace. It was still enduring
    the horrors of the memorable siege when Clement left Bologna at the end of May. The
    last hero of the republic, Francesco Ferrucci, fell fighting at Gavignana on August
    2. Their general, Malatesta Baglioni, broke his faith with the citizens. Finally, on
    August 12, the town capitulated. Alessandro de'Medici, who had received the title of
    Duke of Florence from Charles at Bologna, took up his residence there in July, 1531,
    and held the State by help of Spanish mercenaries under the command of Alessandro
    Vitelli. When he was murdered by his cousin in 1537, Cosimo de'Medici, the scion of
    another branch of the ruling family, was appointed Duke. Charles V. recognized his
    title, and Cosimo soon showed that he was determined to be master in his own duchy.
    He crushed the exiled party of Filippo Strozzi, who attempted a revolution of the
    State, exterminated its leaders, and contrived to rid himself of the powerful
    adherents who had placed him on the throne. But he remained a subservient though not
    very willing ally of Spain; and when he expelled Alessandro Vitelli from the fortress
    that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>{47}</span> commanded
    Florence, he admitted a Spaniard, Don Juan de Luna, in his stead. During the petty
    wars of 1552-56 which Henri II. carried on with Charles V. in Italy, Siena attempted
    to shake off the yoke of a Spanish garrison established there in 1547 under the
    command of Don Hurtado de Mendoza. The citizens appealed to France, who sent them the
    great Marshal, Piero Strozzi, brother of Cosimo's vanquished enemy Filippo. Cosimo
    through these years supported the Spanish cause with troops and money, hoping to
    guide events in his own interest. At length, by the aid of Gian Giacomo Medici,
    sprung from an obscure Milanese family, who had been trained in the Spanish methods
    of warfare, he succeeded in subduing Siena. He now reaped the fruits of his Spanish
    policy. In 1557 Philip II. conceded the Sienese territory, reserving only its forts,
    to the Duke of Florence, who in 1569 obtained the title of Grand Duke of Tuscany from
    Pope Pius V. This title was confirmed by the Empire in 1575 to his son Francesco.</p>
    <p>Thus the republics of Florence and Siena were extinguished. The Grand Duchy of
    Tuscany was created. It became an Italian power of the first magnitude, devoted to
    the absolutist principles of Spanish and Papal sovereignty. The further changes which
    took place in Italy after the year 1530, turned equally to the profit of Spain and
    Rome. These were principally the creation of the Duchy of Parma for the Farnesi
    (1545-1559), of which I <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
    id="page48"></a>{48}</span> shall have to speak in the next chapter; the resumption
    of Ferrara by the Papacy in 1597, which reduced the House of Este to the smaller
    fiefs of Modena and Reggio; the acquisition of Montferrat by Mantua in 1536; the
    cession of Saluzzo to Savoy in 1598, and the absorption of Urbino into the Papal
    domains in 1631.</p>
    <p>It was hoped when Charles and Clement proclaimed the pacification of Italy at
    Bologna on the last day of 1529, that the peninsula would no longer be the theater of
    wars for supremacy between the French and Spaniards. This expectation proved
    delusive; for the struggle soon broke out again. The people, however, suffered less
    extensively than in former years; because the Spanish party, supported by Papal
    authority, was decidedly predominant. The Italian princes, whether they liked it or
    not, were compelled to follow in the main a Spanish policy. At length, in 1559, by
    the Peace of Cateau Cambresis signed between Henri II. and Philip II., the French
    claims were finally abandoned, and the Spanish hegemony was formally acknowledged.
    The later treaty of Vervins, in 1598, ceded Saluzzo to the Duchy of Savoy, and shut
    the gates of Italy to French interference.</p>
    <p>Though the people endured far less misery from foreign armies in the period
    between 1630 and 1600 than they had done in the period from 1494 to 1527, yet the
    state of the country grew ever more and more deplorable. This was due in the first
    instance <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>{49}</span> to the
    insane methods of taxation adopted by the Spanish viceroys, who held monopolies of
    corn and other necessary commodities in their hands and who invented imposts for the
    meanest articles of consumption. Their example was followed by the Pope and petty
    princes. Alfonso II. of Ferrara, for instance, levied a tenth on all produce which
    passed his city gates, and on the capital engaged in every contract. He monopolized
    the sale of salt, flour, bread; and imposed a heavy tax on oil. Sixtus V. by
    exactions of a like description and by the sale of numberless offices, accumulated a
    vast sum of money, much of which bore heavy interest. He was so ignorant of the first
    principle of political economy as to lock up the accruing treasure in the Castle of
    S. Angelo. The rising of Masaniello in Naples was simply due to the exasperation of
    the common folk at having even fruit and vegetables taxed. In addition to such
    financial blunders, we must take into account the policy pursued by all princes at
    this epoch, of discouraging commerce and manufactures. Thus Cosimo I. of Tuscany
    induced the old Florentine families to withdraw their capital from trade, sink it in
    land, create entails in perpetuity on eldest sons, and array themselves with gimcrack
    titles which he liberally supplied. Even Venice showed at this epoch a contempt for
    the commerce which had brought her into a position of unrivaled splendor. This wilful
    depression of industry was partly the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
    id="page50"></a>{50}</span> Spanish aristocratic habits, which now invaded Italian
    society. But it was also deliberately chosen as a means of extinguishing freedom.
    Finally, if war proved now less burdensome, the exhaustion of Italy and the decay of
    military spirit rendered the people liable to the scourge of piracy. The whole
    sea-coast was systematically plundered by the navies of Barbarossa and Dragut. The
    inhabitants of the ports and inland villages were carried off into slavery, and many
    of the Italians themselves drove a brisk trade in the sale of their compatriots.
    Brigandage, following in the wake of agricultural depression and excessive taxation,
    depopulated the central provinces. All these miseries were exacerbated by frequent
    recurrences of plagues and famines.</p>
    <p>It is characteristic of the whole tenor of Italian history that, in spite of the
    virtual hegemony which the Spaniards now exercised in the peninsula, the nation
    continued to exist in separate parcels, each of which retained a certain
    individuality. That Italy could not have been treated as a single province by the
    Spanish autocrat will be manifest, when we consider the European jealousy to which so
    summary an exhibition of force would have given rise. It is also certain that the
    Papacy, which had to be respected, would have resisted an openly declared Spanish
    despotism. But more powerful, I think, than all these considerations together, was
    the past prestige of the Italian States. Europe was not pre<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page51" id="page51"></a>{51}</span> pared to regard that brilliant and hitherto
    respected constellation of commonwealths, from which all intellectual culture, arts
    of life, methods of commerce, and theories of political existence had been diffused,
    as a single province of the Spanish monarchy. The Spaniards themselves were scarcely
    in a position to entertain the thought of reducing the peninsula to bondage <i>vi et
    armis</i>. And if they had attempted any measure tending to this result, they would
    undoubtedly have been resisted by an alliance of the European powers. What they
    sought, and what they gained, was preponderating influence in each of the parcels
    which they recognized as nominally independent.</p>
    <p>The intellectual and social life of the Italians, though much reduced in vigor,
    was therefore still, as formerly, concentrated in cities marked by distinct local
    qualities, and boastful of their ancient glories. The Courts of Ferrara and Urbino
    continued to form centers for literary and artistic coteries. Venice remained the
    stronghold of mental unrestraint and moral license, where thinkers uttered their
    thoughts with tolerable freedom, and libertines indulged their tastes unhindered.
    Rome early assumed novel airs of piety, and external conformity to austere patterns
    became the fashion here. Yet the Papal capital did not wholly cease to be the resort
    of students and of artists. The universities maintained themselves in a respectable
    position&mdash;- far different, indeed, from that which they had held in the last
    century, yet not <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span>
    ignoble. Much was being learned on many lines of study divergent from those
    prescribed by earlier humanists. Padua, in particular, distinguished itself for
    medical researches. This was the flourishing time, moreover, of Academies, in which,
    notwithstanding nonsense talked and foolish tastes indulged, some solid work was done
    for literature and science. The names of the Cimento, Delia Crusca, and Palazzo
    Vernio at Florence, remind us of not unimportant labors in physics, in the analysis
    of language, and in the formation of a new dramatic style of music. At the same time
    the resurgence of popular literature and the creation of popular theatrical types
    deserve to be particularly noticed. It is as though the Italian nation at this epoch,
    suffocated by Spanish etiquette, and poisoned by Jesuitical hypocrisy, sought to
    expand healthy lungs in free spaces of open air, indulging in dialectical niceties
    and immortalizing street-jokes by the genius of masqued comedy.</p>
    <p>This most ancient and intensely vital race had given Europe the Roman Republic,
    the Roman Empire, the system of Roman law, the Romance languages, Latin Christianity,
    the Papacy, and, lastly, all that is included in the art and culture of the
    Renaissance. It was time, perhaps, that it should go to rest a century or so, and
    watch uprising nations&mdash;the Spanish, English, French, and so forth&mdash;stir
    their stalwart limbs in common strife and novel paths of pioneering industry.</p>
    <p>After such fashion let us, then, if we can contrive <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page53" id="page53"></a>{53}</span> to do so, regard the Italians during their
    subjection to the Church and Austria. Were it not for these consolatory reflections,
    and for the present reappearance of the nation in a new and previously unapprehended
    form of unity, the history of the Counter-Reformation period would be almost too
    painful for investigation. What the Italians actually accomplished during this period
    in art, learning, science, and literature, was indeed more than enough to have
    conferred undying luster on such races as the Dutch or Germans at the same epoch. But
    it would be ridiculous to compare Italians with either Dutchmen or Germans at a time
    when Italy was still so incalculably superior. Compared with their own standard,
    compared with what they might have achieved under more favorable conditions of
    national independence, the products of this age are saddening. The tragic elements of
    my present theme are summed up in the fact that Italy during the Counter-Reformation
    was inferior to Italy during the Renaissance, and that this inferiority was due to
    the interruption of vital and organic processes by reactionary forces.</p>
    <p>It would not be just to condemn Spain and the Papacy because, being reactionary
    powers, they quenched for three centuries the genial light of Italy. We must rather
    bear in mind that both Spain and the Papacy were at that time cosmopolitan factors of
    the first magnitude, with perplexing world-problems confronting them. Charles bore
    upon his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> shoulders
    the concerns of the Empire, the burden of the German revolution, and the distracting
    anxiety of a duel with Islam. When his son bowed to the yoke of government, he had to
    meet the same perplexities, complicated with Netherlands in revolt, England in
    antagonism, and France in dubious ferment. A succession of Popes were hampered by
    painful European questions, which the instinct of self-preservation taught them to
    regard as paramount. They were fighting for existence; for the Catholic creed; for
    their own theocratic sovereignty. They held strong cards. But against them were drawn
    up the battalions of heresy, free thought, political insurgence in the modern world.
    The <i>Zeitgeist</i> that has made us what we are, had begun to organize stern
    opposition to the Church. It was natural enough that both the Spanish autocrat and
    the successor of S. Peter should at this crisis have regarded Italian affairs as
    subordinate in importance to wider matters which demanded their attention. Yet if we
    shift our point of view from this high vantage-ground of Imperial and Papal
    anxieties, and place ourselves in the center of Italy as our post of observation, it
    will be apparent that nothing more ruinous for the prosperity of the Italian people
    could have been devised than the joint autocracy accorded at Bologna to two
    cosmopolitan but non-national forces in their midst. An alien monarchy greedy for
    gold, a panic-stricken hierarchy in terror for its life, warped the tendencies and
    throttled the energies of the most artistically <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span> sensitive, the most heroically innovating
    of the existing races. However we may judge the merits of the Spaniards, they were
    assuredly not those which had brought Italy into the first rank of European nations.
    The events of a single century proved that, far from being able to govern other
    peoples, Spain was incapable of self-government on any rational principle. Whatever
    may have been the policy thrust upon the chief of Latin Christianity in the desperate
    struggle with militant rationalism, the repressive measures which it felt bound to
    adopt were eminently pernicious to a race like the Italians, who showed no
    disposition for religious regeneration, and who were yet submitted to the tyranny of
    ecclesiastical discipline and intellectual intolerance at every point.</p>
    <p>The settlement made by Charles V. in 1530, and the various changes which took
    place in the duchies between that date and the end of the century, had then the
    effect of rendering the Papacy and Spain omnipotent in Italy. These kindred autocrats
    were joined in firm alliance, except during the brief period of Paul IV.'s French
    policy, which ended in the Pope's complete discomfiture by Alva in 1557. They used
    their aggregated forces for the riveting of spiritual, political, and social chains
    upon the modern world. What they only partially effected in Europe at large, by means
    of S. Bartholomew massacres, exterminations of Jews in Toledo and of Mussulmans in
    Granada, holocausts of victims in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
    id="page56"></a>{56}</span> the Low Countries, wars against French Huguenots and
    German Lutherans, naval expeditions and plots against the state of England,
    assassinations of heretic princes, and occasional burning of free thinkers, they
    achieved with plenary success in Italy. The center of the peninsula, from Ferrara to
    Terracina, lay at the discretion of the Pope. The Two Sicilies, Sardinia and the
    Duchy of Milan, were absolute dependencies of the Spanish crown. Tuscany was linked
    by ties of interest, and by the stronger bonds of terrorism, to Spain. The
    insignificant principalities of Mantua, Modena, Parma could not do otherwise than
    submit to the same predominant authority. It is not worth while to take into account
    the tiny republics of Genoa and Lucca. Their history through this period, though not
    so uneventful, is scarcely less insignificant than that of San Marino. Venice alone
    stood independent, still powerful enough to extinguish Bedmar's Spanish conspiracy in
    silence, still proud enough to resist the encroachments of Paul V. with spirit, yet
    sensible of her decline and spending her last energies on warfare with the Turk.</p>
    <p>At the close of the century, by the Peace of Vervins in 1598 and two subsequent
    treaties, Spain and France settled their long dispute. France was finally excluded
    from Italy by the cession of Saluzzo to Savoy, while Savoy at the same moment,
    through the loss of its Burgundian provinces, became an Italian power. The old
    antagonism which, dating <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
    id="page57"></a>{57}</span> from the Guelf and Ghibelline contentions of the
    thirteenth century, had taken a new form after the Papal investiture of Charles of
    Anjou with the kingdoms of Sicily and Naples, now ceased. That antique antagonism of
    parties, alien to the home interests of Italy, had been exasperated by the rivalry of
    Angevine and Aragonese princes; had assumed formidable intensity after the invasion
    of Charles VIII. in 1494; and had expanded under the reigns of Louis XII. and Francis
    I. into an open struggle between France and Spain for the supremacy of Italy. It now
    was finally terminated by the exclusion of the French and the acknowledged
    overlordship of the Spaniard. But though peace seemed to be secured to a nation
    tortured by so many desolating wars of foreign armies, the Italians regarded the
    cession of Saluzzo with despondency. The partisans of national independence and
    political freedom had become, however illogically, accustomed to consider France as
    their ally.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
    class="fnanchor">[6]</a> They now beheld the gates of Italy closed against the
    French; they saw the extinction of their ancient Guelf policy of calling French arms
    into Italy. They felt that rest from strife was dearly bought at the price of
    prostrate servitude beneath Spanish and Austrian Hapsburgs, Spanish Bourbons, and
    mongrel princelings bred by crossing these stocks with decaying scions of Italian
    nobility. As a matter of fact, this was the destiny which lay <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> before them for nearly
    two centuries after the signing of the Peace of Vervins.</p>
    <p>Yet the cession of Saluzzo was really the first dawn of hope for Italy. It
    determined the House of Savoy as an Italian dynasty, and brought for the first time
    into the sphere of purely Italian interests that province from which the future
    salvation of the nation was to come. From 1598 until 1870 the destinies of Italy were
    bound up with the advance of Savoy from a duchy to a kingdom, with its growth in
    wealth, military resources and political self-consciousness, and with its ultimate
    acceptance of the task, accomplished in our days, of freeing Italy from foreign
    tyranny and forming a single nation out of many component elements. Those component
    elements by their diversity had conferred luster on the race in the Middle Ages, by
    their jealousies had wrecked its independence in the Renaissance, and by their
    weakness had left it at the period of the Counter-Reformation a helpless prey to
    Papal and Spanish despotism.</p>
    <p>The leveling down of the component elements of the Italian race beneath a common
    despotism, which began in the period I have chosen for this work, was necessary
    perhaps before Italy could take her place as a united nation gifted with
    constitutional self-government and independence. Except, therefore, for the
    sufferings and the humiliations inflicted on her people; except for their servitude
    beneath the most degrading forms of ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span> and temporal tyranny; except for the
    annihilation of their beautiful Renaissance culture; except for the depression of
    arts, learning, science, and literature, together with the enfeeblement of political
    energy and domestic morality; except for the loathsome domination of hypocrites and
    persecutors and informers; except for the Jesuitical encouragement of every secret
    vice and every servile superstition which might emasculate the race and render it
    subservient to authority;&mdash;except for these appalling evils, we have no right
    perhaps to deplore the settlement of Italy by Charles V. in 1530, or the course of
    subsequent events. For it is tolerably certain that some such leveling down as then
    commenced was needed to bring the constituent States of Italy into accord; and it is
    indubitable, as I have had occasion to point out, that the political force which
    eventually introduced Italy into the European system of federated nations, was
    determined in its character, if not created, then. None the less, the history of this
    period (1530-1600) in Italy is a prolonged, a solemn, an inexpressibly heart-rending
    tragedy.</p>
    <p>It is the tragic history of the eldest and most beautiful, the noblest and most
    venerable, the freest and most gifted of Europe's daughters, delivered over to the
    devilry that issued from the most incompetent and arrogantly stupid of the European
    sisterhood, and to the cruelty, inspired by panic, of an impious theocracy. When we
    use these terms to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span>
    designate the Papacy of the Counter-Reformation, it is not that we forget how many of
    those Popes were men of blameless private life and serious views for Catholic
    Christendom. When we use these terms to designate the Spanish race in the sixteenth
    century, it is not that we are ignorant of Spanish chivalry and colonizing
    enterprise, of Spanish romance, or of the fact that Spain produced great painters,
    great dramatists, and one great novelist in the brief period of her glory. We use
    them deliberately, however, in both cases; because the Papacy at this period
    committed itself to a policy of immoral, retrograde, and cowardly repression of the
    most generous of human impulses under the pressure of selfish terror; because the
    Spaniards abandoned themselves to a dark fiend of religious fanaticism; because they
    were merciless in their conquests and unintelligent in their administration of
    subjugated provinces; because they glutted their lusts of avarice and hatred on
    industrious folk of other creeds within their borders; because they cultivated barren
    pride and self-conceit in social life; because at the great epoch of Europe's
    reawakening they chose the wrong side and adhered to it with fatal obstinacy. This
    obstinacy was disastrous to their neighbors and ruinous to themselves. During the
    short period of three reigns (between 1598 and 1700) they sank from the first to the
    third grade in Europe, and saw the scepter passing in the New World from their hands
    to those of more normally <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
    id="page61"></a>{61}</span> constituted races. That the self-abandonment to
    sterilizing passions and ignoble persecutions which marked Spain out for decay in the
    second half of the sixteenth century, and rendered her the curse of her dependencies,
    can in part be ascribed to the enthusiasm aroused in previous generations by the
    heroic conflict with advancing Islam, is a thesis capable of demonstration. Yet none
    the less is it true that her action at that period was calamitous to herself and
    little short of destructive to Italy.</p>
    <p>After the year 1530 seven Spanish devils entered Italy. These were the devil of
    the Inquisition, with stake and torture-room, and war declared against the will and
    soul and heart and intellect of man; the devil of Jesuitry, with its sham learning,
    shameless lying, and casuistical economy of sins; the devil of vice-royal rule, with
    its life-draining monopolies and gross incapacity for government; the devil of an
    insolent soldiery, quartered on the people, clamorous for pay, outrageous in their
    lusts and violences; the devil of fantastical taxation, levying tolls upon the bare
    necessities of life, and drying up the founts of national well-being at their
    sources; the devil of petty-princedom, wallowing in sloth and cruelty upon a
    pinchbeck throne; the devil of effeminate hidalgoism, ruinous in expenditure, mean
    and grasping, corrupt in private life, in public ostentatious, vain of titles,
    cringing to its masters, arrogant to its inferiors. In their train these brought with
    them seven other devils, their pernicious offspring:<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page62" id="page62"></a>{62}</span> idleness, disease, brigandage, destitution,
    ignorance, superstition, hypocritically sanctioned vice. These fourteen devils were
    welcomed, entertained, and voluptuously lodged in all the fairest provinces of Italy.
    The Popes opened wide for them the gates of outraged and depopulated Rome. Dukes and
    marquises fell down and worshiped the golden image of the Spanish
    Belial-Moloch&mdash;that hideous idol whose face was blackened with soot from burning
    human flesh, and whose skirts were dabbled with the blood of thousands slain in wars
    of persecution. After a tranquil sojourn of some years in Italy, these devils had
    everywhere spread desolation and corruption. Broad regions, like the Patrimony of S.
    Peter and Calabria, were given over to marauding bandits; wide tracks of fertile
    country, like the Sienese Maremma, were abandoned to malaria; wolves prowled through
    empty villages round Milan; in every city the pestilence swept off its hundreds
    daily; manufactures, commerce, agriculture, the industries of town and rural
    district, ceased; the Courts swarmed with petty nobles, who vaunted paltry titles;
    and resigned their wives to cicisbei and their sons to sloth: art and learning
    languished; there was not a man who ventured to speak out his thought or write the
    truth; and over the Dead Sea of social putrefaction floated the sickening oil of
    Jesuitical hypocrisy.</p>

    </div>
    <p>It is not easy to define the intellectual and moral changes which passed over
    Italy in the period of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
    id="page64"></a>{64}</span> Counter-Reformation<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
    id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>; it is still
    less easy to refer those changes to distinct causes. Yet some analysis tending toward
    such definition is demanded from a writer who has undertaken to treat of Italian
    culture and manners between the years 1530 and 1600.</p>
    <p>In the last chapter I attempted to describe the depth of servitude to which the
    States of Italy were severally reduced at the end of the wars between France and
    Spain. The desolation of the country, the loss of national independence, and the
    dominance of an alien race, can be counted among the most important of those
    influences which produced the changes in question. Whatever opinions we may hold
    regarding the connection between political autonomy and mental vigor in a people, it
    can hardly be disputed that a sudden and universal extinction of liberty must be
    injurious to arts and studies that have grown up under free institutions.</p>
    <p>But there were other causes at work. Among these a prominent place should be given
    to an alteration in the intellectual interests of the Italians themselves. The
    original impulses of the Renaissance, in scholarship, painting, sculpture,
    architecture, and vernacular poetry, had been exhausted.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span></p>
    <p>Humanism, after recovering the classics and forming a new ideal of culture, was
    sinking into pedantry and academic erudition. Painting and sculpture, having
    culminated in the great work of Michelangelo, tended toward a kind of empty
    mannerism. Architecture settled down into the types fixed by Palladio and Barozzi.
    Poetry seemed to have reached its highest point of development in Ariosto. The main
    motives supplied to art by mediaeval traditions and humanistic enthusiasm were worked
    out. Nor was this all. The Renaissance had created a critical spirit which penetrated
    every branch of art and letters. It was not possible to advance further on the old
    lines; yet painters, sculptors, architects, and poets of the rising generation had
    before their eyes the masterpieces of their predecessors, in their minds the precepts
    of the learned. All alike were rendered awkward and self-conscious by the sense of
    laboring at a disadvantage, and by the dread of academical censorship.</p>
    <p>In truth, this critical spirit, which was the final product of the Renaissance in
    Italy, favored the development of new powers in the nation: it hampered workers in
    the elder spheres of art, literature, and scholarship; but it set thinkers upon the
    track of those investigations which we call scientific. I shall endeavor, in a future
    chapter, to show how the Italians were now upon the point of carrying the ardor of
    the Renaissance into fresh fields of physical discovery and speculation, when their
    evolution <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>{66}</span> was
    suspended by the Catholic Reaction. But here it must suffice to observe that
    formalism had succeeded by the operation of natural influences to the vigor and
    inventiveness of the national genius in the main departments of literature and fine
    art.</p>
    <p>If we study the development of other European races, we shall find that each of
    them in turn, at its due season, passed through similar phases. The mediaeval period
    ends in the efflorescence of a new delightful energy, which gives a Rabelais, a
    Shakspere, a Cervantes to the world. The Renaissance riots itself away in Marinism,
    Gongorism, Euphuism, and the affectations of the H&ocirc;tel Rambouillet. This age is
    succeeded by a colder, more critical, more formal age of obedience to fixed canons,
    during which scholarly efforts are made to purify style and impose laws on taste. The
    ensuing period of sense is also marked by profounder inquiries into nature and more
    exact analysis of mental operations. The correct school of poets, culminating in
    Dryden and Pope, holds sway in England; while Newton, Locke, and Bentley extend the
    sphere of science. In France the age of Rabelais and Montaigne yields place to the
    age of Racine and Descartes. Germany was so distracted by religious wars, Spain was
    so down-trodden by the Inquisition, that they do not offer equally luminous
    examples.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8"
    class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It may be added that in all these nations the end of the
    eighteenth and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>{67}</span> the
    beginning of the nineteenth centuries are marked by a similar revolt against
    formality and common sense, to which we give the name of the Romantic movement.</p>
    <p>Quitting this sphere of speculation, we may next point out that the European
    system had undergone an incalculable process of transformation. Powerful
    nationalities were in existence, who, having received their education from Italy,
    were now beginning to think and express thought with marked originality. The Italians
    stood no longer in a relation of uncontested intellectual superiority to these
    peoples, while they met them under decided disadvantages at all points of political
    efficiency. The Mediterranean had ceased to be the high road of commercial enterprise
    and naval energy. Charles V.'s famous device of the two columns, with its motto
    <i>Plus Ultra</i>, indicated that illimitable horizons had been opened, that an age
    had begun in which Spain, England and Holland should dispute the sovereignty of the
    Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Italy was left, with diminished forces of resistance, to
    bear the brunt of Turk and Arab depredations. The point of gravity in the civilized
    world had shifted. The Occidental nations looked no longer toward the South of
    Europe.</p>
    <p>While these various causes were in operation, Catholic Christianity showed signs
    of re-wakening. The Reformation called forth a new and sincere spirit in the Latin
    Church; new antagonisms were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
    id="page68"></a>{68}</span> evoked, and new efforts after self-preservation had to be
    made by the Papal hierarchy. The center of the world-wide movement which is termed
    the Counter-Reformation was naturally Rome. Events had brought the Holy See once more
    into a position of prominence. It was more powerful as an Italian State now, through
    the support of Spain and the extinction of national independence, than at any
    previous period of history. In Catholic Christendom its prestige was immensely
    augmented by the Council of Trent. At the same epoch, the foreigners who dominated
    Italy, threw themselves with the enthusiasm of fanaticism into this Revival. Spain
    furnished Rome with the militia of the Jesuits and with the engines of the
    Inquisition. The Papacy was thus able to secure successes in Italy which were
    elsewhere only partially achieved. It followed that the moral, social, political and
    intellectual activities of the Italians at this period were controlled and colored by
    influences hostile to the earlier Renaissance. Italy underwent a metamorphosis,
    prescribed by the Papacy and enforced by Spanish rule. In the process of this
    transformation the people submitted to rigid ecclesiastical discipline, and adopted,
    without assimilating, the customs of a foreign troop of despots.</p>
    <p>At first sight we may wonder that the race which had shone with such incomparable
    luster from Dante to Ariosto, and which had done so much to create modern culture for
    Europe, should <span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>{69}</span> so
    quietly have accepted a retrogressive revolution. Yet, when we look closer, this is
    not surprising. The Italians were fatigued with creation, bewildered by the
    complexity of their discoveries, uncertain as to the immediate course before them.
    The Renaissance had been mainly the work of a select few. It had transformed society
    without permeating the masses of the people. Was it strange that the majority should
    reflect that, after all, the old ways are the best? This led them to approve the
    Catholic Revival. Was it strange that, after long distracting aimless wars, they
    should hail peace at any price? This lent popular sanction to the Spanish hegemony,
    in spite of its obvious drawbacks.</p>
    <p>These may be reckoned the main conditions which gave a peculiar but not easily
    definable complexion of languor, melancholy, and dwindling vitality to nearly every
    manifestation of Italian genius in the second half of the sixteenth century, and
    which well nigh sterilized that genius during the two succeeding centuries. In common
    with the rest of Europe, and in consequence of an inevitable alteration of their
    mental bias, they had lost the blithe spontaneity of the Renaissance. But they were
    at the same time suffering from grievous exhaustion, humiliated by the tyranny of
    foreign despotism, and terrorized by ecclesiastical intolerance. In their case,
    therefore, a sort of moral and intellectual atrophy becomes gradually more and more
    perceptible. The clear artistic sense of rightness and of beauty yields to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span> doubtful taste. The
    frank audacity of the Renaissance is superseded by cringing timidity, lumbering
    dulness, somnolent and stagnant acquiescence in accepted formulae. At first the best
    minds of the nation fret and rebel, and meet with the dungeon or the stake as the
    reward of contumacy. In the end everybody seems to be indifferent, satisfied with
    vacuity, enamored of insipidity. The brightest episode in this dreary period is the
    emergence of modern music with incomparable sweetness and lucidity.</p>
    <p>It must not be supposed that the change which I have adumbrated, passed rapidly
    over the Italian spirit. When Paul III. succeeded Clement on the Papal throne in
    1534, some of the giants of the Renaissance still survived, and much of their great
    work was yet to be accomplished. Michelangelo had neither painted the Last Judgment
    nor planned the cupola which crowns S. Peter's. Cellini had not cast his Perseus for
    the Loggia de'Lanzi, nor had Palladio raised San Giorgio from the sea at Venice.
    Pietro Aretino still swaggered in lordly insolence; and though Machiavelli was dead,
    the 'silver histories' of Guicciardini remained to be written. Bandello, Giraldi and
    Il Lasca had not published their Novelle, nor had Cecchi given the last touch to
    Florentine comedy. It was chiefly at Venice, which preserved the ancient forms of her
    oligarchical independence, that the grand style of the Renaissance continued to
    flourish. Titian was in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
    id="page71"></a>{71}</span> prime; the stars of Tintoretto and Veronese had scarcely
    risen above the horizon. Sansovino was still producing masterpieces of picturesque
    beauty in architecture.</p>
    <p>In order to understand the transition of Italy from the Renaissance to the
    Counter-Reformation manner, it will be well to concentrate attention on the history
    of the Papacy during the eight reigns of Paul III., Julius III., Paul IV., Pius IV.,
    Pius V., Gregory XIII., Sixtus V., and Clement VIII.<a name="FNanchor_9_9"
    id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In the first
    of these reigns we hardly notice that the Renaissance has passed away. In the last we
    are aware of a completely altered Italy. And we perceive that this alteration has
    been chiefly due to the ecclesiastical policy which brought the Council of Trent to a
    successful issue in the reign of Pius IV.</p>
    <p>Before engaging in this review of Papal history, I must give some brief account of
    the more serious religious spirit which had been developed within the Italian Church;
    since the determination of this spirit toward rigid Catholicism in the second half of
    the sixteenth century decided the character of Italian manners and culture.
    Protestantism in the strict sense of the term took but little hold upon Italian
    society. It is true that the minds of some philosophical students were deeply stirred
    by the audacious discussion of theological principles in Germany. Such men had been
    rendered receptive of new im<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
    id="page72"></a>{72}</span> pressions by the Platonizing speculations of Ficino and
    Pico della Mirandola, as well as by the criticism of the Bible in its original
    languages which formed a subordinate branch of humanistic education. They had,
    furthermore, been powerfully affected by the tribulations of Rome at the time of
    Bourbon's occupation, and had grown to regard these as a divine chastisement
    inflicted on the Church for its corruption and ungodliness. Lutheranism so far
    influenced their opinions that they became convinced of the necessity of a return to
    the simpler elements of Christianity in creed and conduct. They considered a
    thorough-going reform of the hierarchy and of all Catholic institutions to be
    indispensable. They leant, moreover, with partiality to some of the essential tenets
    of the Reformation, notably to the doctrines of justification by faith and salvation
    by the merits of Christ, and also to the principle that Scripture is the sole
    authority in matters of belief and discipline. Thus both the Cardinals Morone and
    Contarini, the poet Flaminio, and the nobles of the Colonna family in Naples who
    imbibed the teaching of Valdes, fell under the suspicion of heterodoxy on these
    points. But it was characteristic of the members of this school that they had no will
    to withhold allegiance from the Pope as chief of Christendom. They shrank with horror
    from the thought of encouraging a schism or of severing themselves from the communion
    of Catholics. The essential difference between Italian and Teutonic thinkers on <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>{73}</span> such subjects at this
    epoch seems to have been this: Italians could not cease to be Catholics without at
    the same time ceasing to be Christians. They could not accommodate their faith to any
    of the compromises suggested by the Reformation. Even when they left their country in
    a spirit of rebellion, they felt ill at ease both with Lutherans and Calvinists. Like
    Bernardino Ochino and the Anti-Trinitarians of the Socinian sect, they wandered
    restlessly through Europe, incapable of settling down in communion with any one of
    the established forms of Protestantism. Calvin at Geneva instituted a real crusade
    against Italian thinkers, who differed from his views. He drove Valentino Gentile to
    death on the scaffold; and expelled Gribaldi, Simone, Biandrata, Alciati, Negro. Most
    of these men found refuge in Poland, Transylvania, even Turkey.<a
    name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
    class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
    <p>There were bold speculators in Italy enough, who had practically abandoned the
    Catholic faith. But the majority of these did not think it worth their while to make
    an open rupture with the Church. Theological hair-splitting reminded them only of the
    mediaeval scholasticism from which they had been emancipated by classical culture.
    They were less interested in questions touching the salvation of the individual or
    the exact nature of the sacraments, than in metaphysical problems suggested by the
    study of antique philosophers, or new theories of the material universe.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span></p>
    <p>The indifference of these men in religion rendered it easy for them to conform in
    all external points to custom. Their fundamental axiom was that a scientific thinker
    could hold one set of opinions as a philosopher, and another set as a Christian.
    Their motto was the celebrated <i>Foris ut moris, intus ut libet</i>.<a
    name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
    class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Nor were ecclesiastical authorities dissatisfied with this
    attitude during the ascendancy of humanistic culture. It was, indeed, the attitude of
    Popes like Leo, Cardinals like Bembo. And it only revealed its essential weakness
    when the tide of general opinion, under the blast of Teutonic revolutionary ideas,
    turned violently in favor of formal orthodoxy. Then indeed it became dangerous to
    adopt the position of a Pomponazzo.</p>
    <p>The mental attitude of such men is so well illustrated by a letter written by
    Celio Calcagnini to Peregrino Morato, that I shall not hesitate to transcribe it
    here. It seems that Morato had sent his correspondent some treatise on the
    theological questions then in dispute; and Calcagnini replies:</p>
    <p>'I have read the book relating to the controversies so much agitated at present. I
    have thought on its contents, and weighed them in the balance of reason. I find in it
    nothing which may not be approved and defended, but some things which, as mysteries,
    it is safer to suppress and conceal than to bring before the common people, inasmuch
    as they pertained to the primitive and infant state of the<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> Church. Now, when the decrees of the
    fathers and long usage have introduced other modes, what necessity is there for
    reviving antiquated practices which have long fallen into desuetude, especially as
    neither piety nor the salvation of the soul is concerned with them? Let us, then, I
    pray you, allow these things to rest. Not that I disapprove of their being embraced
    by scholars and lovers of antiquity; but I would not have them communicated to the
    common people and those who are fond of innovations, lest they give occasion to
    strife and sedition. There are unlearned and unqualified persons who having, after
    long ignorance, read or heard certain new opinions respecting baptism, the marriage
    of the clergy, ordination, the distinction of days and food, and public penitence,
    instantly conceive that these things are to be stiffly maintained and observed.
    Wherefore, in my opinion, the discussion of these points ought to be confined to the
    initiated, that so the seamless coat of our Lord may not be rent and torn.... Seeing
    it is dangerous to treat such things before the multitude and in public discourses, I
    must deem it safest to "speak with the many and think with the few," and to keep in
    mind the advice of Paul, "Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God."'<a
    name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
    class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
    <p>The new religious spirit which I have attempted to characterize as tinctured by
    Protestant opinions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
    id="page76"></a>{76}</span> but disinclined for severance from Rome, manifested
    itself about the same time in several groups. One of them was at Rome, where a
    society named the Oratory of Divine Love, including from fifty to sixty members,
    began to meet as early as the reign of Leo X. in the Trastevere. This pious
    association included men of very various kinds. Sadoleto, Giberto, and Contarini were
    here in close intimacy with Gaetano di Thiene, the sainted founder of the Theatines,
    and with his friend Caraffa, the founder of the Roman Inquisition. Venice was the
    center of another group, among whom may be mentioned Reginald Pole, Gasparo
    Contarini, Luigi Priuli, and Antonio Bruccioli, the translator of the Bible from the
    original tongues into Italian. The poet Marcantonio Flaminio became a member of both
    societies; and was furthermore the personal friend of the Genoese Cardinals Sauli and
    Fregoso, whom we have a right to count among thinkers of the same class. Flaminio,
    though he died in the Catholic communion, was so far suspected of heresy that his
    works were placed upon the Index of 1559. In Naples Juan Valdes made himself the
    leader of a similar set of men. His views, embodied in the work of a disciple, and
    revised by Marcantonio Flaminio, <i>On the Benefits of Christ's Death</i>, revealed
    strong Lutheran tendencies, which at a later period would certainly have condemned
    him to perpetual imprisonment or exile. This book had a wide circulation in Italy,
    and was influential in directing the minds <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
    id="page77"></a>{77}</span> of thoughtful Christians to the problems of
    Justification. It was ascribed to Aonio Paleario, who suffered martyrdom at Rome for
    maintaining doctrines similar to those of Valdes.<a name="FNanchor_13_13"
    id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Round him
    gathered several members of the great Colonna family, notably Vespasiano, Duke of
    Palliano, and his wife, the star of Italian beauty, Giulia Gonzaga. Vittoria Colonna,
    Marchioness of Pescara, imbibed the new doctrines in the same circle; and so did
    Bernardino Ochino. Modena could boast another association, which met in the house of
    Grillenzone; while Ferrara became the headquarters of a still more pronounced
    reforming party under the patronage of the Duchess, Ren&eacute;e of France, daughter
    of Louis XII. These various societies and coteries were bound together by ties of
    friendship and literary correspondence, and were indirectly connected with less
    fortunate reforming theologians; with Aonio Paleario, Bernardino Ochino, Antonio dei
    Pagliaricci, Carnesecchi, and others, whose tragic history will form a part of my
    chapter on the Inquisition.</p>
    <p>It does not fall within the province of this chapter to write an account of what
    has, not very appropriately, been called the Reformation in Italy. My purpose in the
    present book is, not to follow the for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
    id="page78"></a>{78}</span> tunes of Protestantism, but to trace the sequel of the
    Renaissance, the merging of its impulse in new phases of European development. I
    shall therefore content myself with pointing out that at the opening of Paul III.'s
    reign, there was widely diffused throughout the chief Italian cities a novel spirit
    of religious earnestness and enthusiasm, which as yet had taken no determinate
    direction. This spirit burned most highly in Gasparo Contarini, who in 1541 was
    commissioned by the Pope to attend a conference at Rechensburg for the discussion of
    terms of reconciliation with the Lutherans. He succeeded in drawing up satisfactory
    articles on the main theological points regarding human nature, original sin,
    redemption and justification. These were accepted by the Protestant theologians at
    Rechensburg and might possibly have been ratified in Rome, had not the Congress been
    broken up by Contarini's total failure to accommodate differences touching the Pope's
    supremacy and the conciliar principle.<a name="FNanchor_14_14"
    id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> He made
    concessions to the Reformers, which roused the fury of the Roman Curia. At the same
    time political intrigues were set on foot in France and Germany to avert a
    reconciliation which would have immeasurably strengthened the Emperor's position. The
    moderate sections of both parties, Lutheran and Catholic, failed at Rechensburg.
    Indeed, it was inevi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
    id="page79"></a>{79}</span> table that they should fail; for the breach between the
    Roman Church and the Reformation was not of a nature to be healed over at this date.
    Principles were involved which could not now be harmonized, and both parties in the
    dispute were on the point of developing their own forces with fresh internal
    vigor.</p>
    <p>The Italians who desired reform of the Church were now thrown back upon the
    attempt to secure this object within the bosom of Catholicism. At the request of Paul
    III. they presented a memorial on ecclesiastical abuses, which was signed by
    Contarini, Caraffa, Sadoleto, Pole, Fregoso, Giberto, Cortese and Aleander. These
    Cardinals did not spare plain speech upon the burning problem of Papal
    misgovernment.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the new spirit began to manifest itself in the foundation of orders and
    institutions tending to purification of Church discipline. The most notable of these
    was the order of Theatines established by Thiene and Caraffa. Its object was to
    improve the secular priesthood, with a view to which end seminaries were opened for
    the education of priests, who took monastic vows and devoted themselves to special
    observance of their clerical duties, as preachers, administrators of the sacraments,
    visitors of the poor and sick.</p>
    <p>A Venetian, Girolamo Miani, at the same period founded a congregation, called the
    Somascan, for the education of the destitute and orphaned, and for the reception of
    the sick and infirm into hospitals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
    id="page80"></a>{80}</span> The terrible state in which Lombardy had been left by war
    rendered this institution highly valuable. Of a similar type was the order of the
    Barnabites, who were first incorporated at Milan, charged with the performance of
    acts of mercy, education, preaching, and other forms of Christian ministration. It
    may be finally added that the Camaldolese and Franciscan orders had been in part
    reformed by a spontaneous movement within their bodies.</p>
    <p>If we compare the spirit indicated by these efforts in the first half of the
    sixteenth century with that of the earlier Renaissance, it will be evident that the
    Italians were ready for religious change. They sink, however, into insignificance
    beside two Spanish institutions which about the same period added their weight and
    influence to the Catholic revival. I mean, of course, the Inquisition and the Jesuit
    order. Paul III. empowered Caraffa in 1542 to re-establish the Inquisition in Rome
    upon a new basis resembling that of the Spanish Holy Office. The same Pope sanctioned
    and confirmed the Company of Jesus between the years 1540 and 1543. The establishment
    of the Inquisition gave vast disciplinary powers to the Church at the moment when the
    Council of Trent fixed her dogmas and proclaimed the absolute authority of the Popes.
    At the same time the Jesuits, devoted by their founder in blind
    obedience&mdash;<i>perinde ac cadaver</i>&mdash;to the service of the Papacy,
    penetrated Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the transatlantic colonies.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>{81}</span> The Pope who
    succeeded Clement VII. in 1534 was in all ways fitted to represent the transition
    which I have indicated. Alessandro Farnese sprang from an ancient but decayed family
    in the neighborhood of Bolsena, several of whose members had played a foremost part
    in the mediaeval revolutions of Orvieto. While still a young man of twenty-five, he
    was raised to the Cardinalate by Alexander VI. This advancement he owed to the
    influence of his sister Giulia, surnamed La Bella, who was then the Borgia's
    mistress. It is characteristic of an epoch during which the bold traditions of the
    fifteenth century still lingered, that the undraped statue of this Giulia
    (representing Vanity) was carved for the basement of Paul III.'s monument in the
    choir of S. Peter's. The old stock of the Farnesi, once planted in the soil of Papal
    corruption at its most licentious period, struck firm roots and flourished.
    Alessandro was born in 1468, and received a humanistic education according to the
    methods of the earlier Renaissance. He studied literature with Pomponius Laetus in
    the Roman Academy, and frequented the gardens of Lorenzo de'Medici at Florence. His
    character and intellect were thus formed under the influences of the classical
    revival and of the Pontifical Curia, at a time when pagan morality and secular policy
    had obliterated the ideal of Catholic Christianity. His sister was the Du Barry of
    the Borgian Court. He was himself the father of several illegitimate children, whom
    he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span> acknowledged,
    and on whose advancement by the old system of Papal nepotism he spent the best years
    of his reign. Both as a patron of the arts and as an elegant scholar in the Latin and
    Italian languages, Alessandro showed throughout his life the effects of this early
    training. He piqued himself on choice expression, whenever he was called upon to use
    the pen in studied documents, or to answer ambassadors in public audiences. To his
    taste and love of splendor Rome owes the Farnese palace. He employed Cellini, and
    forced Michelangelo to paint the Last Judgment. On ascending the Papal throne he
    complained that this mighty genius had been too long occupied for Delia Roveres and
    Medici. When the fresco was finished, he set the old artist upon his last great task
    of completing S. Peter's.</p>
    <p>So far there was nothing to distinguish Alessandro Farnese from other
    ecclesiastics of the Renaissance. As Cardinal he seemed destined, should he ever
    attain the Papal dignity, to combine the qualities of the Borgian and Medicean
    Pontiffs. But before his elevation to that supreme height, he lived through the
    reigns of Julius II., Leo X., Adrian VI., and Clement VII. Herein lies the
    peculiarity of his position as Paul III. The pupil of Pomponius Laetus, the creature
    of Roderigo Borgia, the representative of Italian manners and culture before the age
    of foreign invasion had changed the face of Italy, Paul III. was called at the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span> age of sixty-six to
    steer the ship of the Church through troubled waters and in very altered
    circumstances. He had witnessed the rise and progress of Protestant revolt in
    Germany. He had observed the stirrings of a new and sincere spirit of religious
    gravity, an earnest desire for ecclesiastical reform in his own country. He had
    watched the duel between France and Spain, during the course of which his
    predecessors Alexander V. and Julius II. restored the secular authority of Rome. He
    had seen that authority humbled to the dust in 1527, and miraculously rehabilitated
    at Bologna in 1530. He had learned by the example of the Borgias how difficult it was
    for any Papal family to found a substantial principality; and the vicissitudes of
    Florence and Urbino had confirmed this lesson. Finally, he had assisted at the
    coronation of Charles V.; and when he took the reins of power into his hands, he was
    well aware with what a formidable force he had to cope in the great Emperor.</p>
    <p>Paul III. knew that the old Papal game of pitting France against Spain in the
    peninsula could not be played on the same grand scale as formerly. This policy had
    been pursued with results ruinous to Italy but favorable to the Church, by Julius. It
    had enabled Leo and Clement to advance their families at the hazard of more important
    interests. But in the reign of the latter Pope it had all but involved the Papacy
    itself in the general confusion and desolation of the country. Moreover, France <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span> was no longer an
    effective match for Spain; and though their struggle was renewed, the issue was
    hardly doubtful. Spain had got too firm a grip upon the land to be cast off.</p>
    <p>Yet Paul was a man of the elder generation. It could not be expected that a Pope
    of the Renaissance should suddenly abandon the mediaeval policy of Papal hostility to
    the Empire, especially when the Empire was in the hands of so omnipotent a master as
    Charles. It could not be expected that he should recognize the wisdom of confining
    Papal ambition to ecclesiastical interests, and of forming a defensive and offensive
    alliance with Catholic sovereigns for the maintenance of absolutism. It could not be
    expected that he should forego the pleasures and apparent profits of creating duchies
    for his bastards, whereby to dignify his family and strengthen his personal authority
    as a temporal sovereign. It is true that the experience of the last half century had
    pointed in the direction of all these changes; and it is certain that the series of
    events connected with the Council of Trent, which began in Paul III.'s reign,
    rendered them both natural and necessary. Yet Paul, as a man of the elder generation
    filling the Papal throne for fifteen years during a period of transition, adhered in
    the main to the policy of his predecessors. It was fortunate for him and for the Holy
    See that the basis of his character was caution combined with tough tenacity of
    purpose, capacity for dilatory action, diplomatic shiftiness and a poli<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> tical versatility that
    can best be described by the word trimming. These qualities enabled him to pass with
    safety through perils that might have ruined a bolder, a hastier, or a franker Pope,
    and to achieve the object of his heart's desire, where stronger men had failed, in
    the foundation of a solid duchy for his heirs.</p>
    <p>Paul's jealousy of the Spanish ascendancy in Italian affairs caused him to waver
    between the Papal and Imperial, Guelf and Ghibelline, parties. These names had lost
    much of their significance; but the habit of distinction into two camps was so rooted
    in Italian manners, that each city counted its antagonistic factions, maintained by
    various forms of local organization and headed by the leading families.<a
    name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
    class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Burigozzo, under the year 1517, tells how the whole
    population of Milan was divided between Guelfs and Ghibellines, wearing different
    costumes; and it is not uncommon to read of petty nobles in the country at this
    period, who were styled Captains of one or the other party.</p>
    <p>The wars between France and Spain revived the almost obsolete dispute, which the
    despots of the fifteenth century and the diplomatic confederation of the five great
    powers had tended in large measure to erase. The Guelfs and Ghibellines <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span> were now partisans of
    France and Spain respectively. Thus a true political importance was regained for the
    time-honored factions; and in the distracted state of Italy they were further
    intensified by the antagonism between exiles and the ruling families in cities. If
    Cosimo de'Medici, for example, was a Ghibelline or Spanish partisan, it followed as a
    matter of course that Filippo Strozzi was a Guelf and stood for France. Paul III.
    managed to maintain himself by manipulating these factions and holding the balance
    between them for the advantage of his family and of the Church.</p>
    <p>He thus succeeded in creating the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza for his son, Pier
    Luigi Farnese, that outrageous representative of the worst vices and worst violences
    of the Renaissance. It will be remembered that Julius had detached these two cities
    from the Duchy of Milan, and annexed them to the Papal States, on the plea that they
    formed part of the old Exarchate of Ravenna. When Charles decided against this plea
    in the matter of Modena and Reggio, he left the Church in occupation of Parma and
    Piacenza. Paul created his son Duke of Nepi and Castro in 1537, and afterwards
    conferred the Duchy of Camerino on his grandson, Ottavio, who was then married to
    Margaret of Austria, daughter of Charles V., and widow of the murdered Alessandro
    de'Medici. The usual system of massacre, exile, and confiscation had reduced the
    signorial family of the Varani at Camerino to extremities. The <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span> fief reverted to the
    Church, and Paul induced the Cardinals to sanction his investiture of Ottavio Farnese
    with its rights and honors. He subsequently explained to them that it would be more
    profitable for the Holy See to retain Camerino and to relinquish Parma and Piacenza
    to the Farnesi in exchange. There was sense in this arrangement; for Camerino formed
    an integral part of the Papal States, while Parma and Piacenza were held under a more
    than doubtful title. Pier Luigi did not long survive his elevation to the dukedom of
    Parma. He was murdered by his exasperated subjects in 1547. His son, Ottavio, with
    some difficulty, maintained his hold upon this principality, until in 1559 he
    established himself and his heirs, with the approval of Philip II., in its perpetual
    enjoyment. The Farnesi repaid Spanish patronage by constant service, Alessandro,
    Prince of Parma, and son of Ottavio, being illustrious in the annals of the
    Netherlands. It would not have been worth while to enlarge on this foundation of the
    Duchy of Parma, had it not furnished an excellent example of my theme. By this act
    Paul III. proved himself a true and able inheritor of those political traditions by
    which all Pontiffs from Sixtus IV. to Clement VII. had sought to establish their
    relatives in secular princedoms. It was the last eminent exhibition of that policy,
    the last and the most brilliant display of nepotistical ambition in a Pope. A new age
    had opened, in which such schemes became impossible&mdash;when Popes could no <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span> longer dare to
    acknowledge and legitimize their bastards, and when they had to administer their
    dominions exclusively for the temporal and ecclesiastical aggrandizement of the
    tiara.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, Paul was living under the conditions which brought this modern
    attitude of the Papacy into potent actuality. He was surrounded by intellectual and
    moral forces of recent growth but of incalculable potency. One of the first acts of
    his reign was to advance six members of the moderate reforming party&mdash;Sadoleto,
    Pole, Giberto, Federigo, Fregoso, Gasparo Contarini, and G.M. Caraffa&mdash;to the
    Cardinalate. By this exercise of power he showed his willingness to recognize new
    elements of very various qualities in the Catholic hierarchy. Five of these men
    represented opinions which at the moment of their elevation to the purple had a fair
    prospect of ultimate success. Imbued with a profound sense of the need for
    ecclesiastical reform, and tinctured more or less deeply with so-called Protestant
    opinions, they desired nothing more intensely than a reconstitution of the Catholic
    Church upon a basis which might render reconciliation with the Lutherans practicable.
    They had their opportunity during the pontificate of Paul III. It was a splendid one;
    and, as I have already shown, the Conference of Rechensburg only just failed in
    securing the end they so profoundly desired. But the Papacy was not prepared to
    concede so much as they were anxious to grant: the German Reformers proved <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span> intractable; they were
    themselves impeded by their loyalty to antique Catholic traditions, and by their
    dread of a schism; finally, the militant expansive force of Spanish orthodoxy,
    expressing itself already in the concentrated energy of the Jesuit order, rendered
    attempts at fusion impossible. The victory in Rome remained with the faction of
    <i>intransigeant</i> Catholics; and this was represented, in Paul III.'s first
    creation of Cardinals, by Caraffa. Caraffa was destined to play a singular part in
    the transition period of Papal history which I am reviewing. He belonged as
    essentially to the future as Alessandro Farnese belonged to the past. He embodied the
    spirit of the Inquisition, and upheld the principles of ecclesiastical reform upon
    the narrow basis of Papal absolutism. He openly signalized his disapproval of Paul's
    nepotism; and when his time for ruling came, he displayed a remorseless spirit of
    justice without mercy in dealing with his own family. Yet he hated the Spanish
    ascendancy with a hatred far more fierce and bitter than that of Paul III. His
    ineffectual efforts to shake off the yoke of Philip II. was the last spasm of the
    older Papal policy of resistance to temporal sovereigns, the last appeal made in
    pursuance of that policy to France by an Italian Pontiff.<a name="FNanchor_16_16"
    id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span> The object of
    this excursion into the coming period is to show in how deep a sense Paul III. may be
    regarded as the beginner of a new era, while he was at the same time the last
    continuator of the old. The Cardinals whom he promoted on his accession included the
    chief of those men who strove in vain for a concordat between Rome and Reformation;
    it also included the man who stamped Rome with the impress of the
    Counter-Reformation. Yet Caraffa would not have had the fulcrum needed for this
    decisive exertion of power, had it not been for another act of Paul's reign. This was
    the convening of a Council at Trent. Paul's attitude toward the Council, which he
    summoned with reluctance, which he frustrated as far as in him lay, and the final
    outcome of which he was far from anticipating, illustrates in a most decisive manner
    his destiny as Pope of the transition.</p>
    <p>The very name of a Council was an abomination to the Papacy. This will be apparent
    if we consider the previous history of the Church during the first half of the
    fifteenth century, when the conciliar authority was again invoked to regulate the
    Papal See and to check Papal encroachments on the realms and Churches of the Western
    nations. The removal of the Papal Court to Avignon, the great schism which resulted
    from this measure, and the dissent which spread from England to Bohemia at the close
    of the fourteenth century, rendered it necessary that the representative powers of
    Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> tendom should
    combine for the purpose of restoring order in the Church. Four main points lay before
    the powers of Europe, thus brought for the first time into deliberative and
    confederated congress to settle questions that vitally concerned them. The most
    immediately urgent was the termination of the schism, and the appointment of one
    Pope, who should represent the mediaeval idea of ecclesiastical face to face with
    imperial unity. The second was the definition of the indeterminate and ever-widening
    authority which the Popes asserted over the kingdoms and the Churches of the West.
    The third was the eradication of heresies which were rending Christendom asunder and
    threatening to destroy that ideal of unity in creed to which the Middle Ages clung
    with not unreasonable passion. The fourth was a reform of the Church, considered as a
    vital element of Western Christendom, in its head and in its members.</p>
    <p>The programme, very indistinctly formulated by the most advanced thinkers of the
    age, and only gradually developed by practice into actuality, was a vast one. It
    involved the embitterment of national jealousies, the accentuation of national
    characteristics, and the complication of antagonistic principles regarding secular
    and ecclesiastical government, which rendered a complete and satisfactory solution
    well-nigh impracticable. The effort to solve these problems had, however, important
    influence in creating conditions under which the politico-religious struggles <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>{92}</span> of the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries were conducted.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
    id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
    <p>The first Council, opened at Pisa in 1409, was a congress of prelates summoned by
    Cardinals for the conclusion of the schism. It deposed two Popes, who still continued
    to assert their titles; it elected a third, Alexander V., who had no real authority.
    For the rest, it effected no reform, and cannot be said to have done much more than
    to give effect to those aspirations after Church-government by means of Councils
    which had been slowly forming during the continuance of the schism.</p>
    <p>The second Council, opened at Constance in 1414, was a Council not convened by
    Cardinals, but by the universal demand of Europe that the advances of the Papacy
    toward tyranny should be checked, and that the innumerable abuses of the Church and
    Papal Curia should be reformed. It received a different complexion from that of Pisa,
    through the presidency of the Emperor and the attendance of representatives from the
    chief nations. At Constance the Papacy and the Roman Curia stood together, exposed to
    the hostile criticism of Europe. The authority of a General Council was, after a
    sharp conflict, decreed superior to that of the Bishop of Rome. Three Popes were
    forced to abdicate; and a fourth, Martin V., was elected.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span></p>
    <p>The Council further undertook to deal with heresy and with the reform of the
    Church. It discharged the first of these offices by condemning Hus and Jerome of
    Prague to the stake. It left the second practically untouched. Yet the question of
    reform had been gravely raised, largely discussed, and fundamentally examined. Two
    methods were posed at Constance for the future consideration of earnest thinkers
    throughout Europe. One was the way suggested by John Hus; that the Church should be
    reconstituted, after a searching analysis of the real bases of Christian conduct, an
    appeal to Scripture as the final authority, and a loyal endeavor to satisfy the
    spiritual requirements of individual souls and consciences. The second plan was that
    of inquiry into the existing order of the Church and detailed amendment of its
    flagrant faults, with preservation of the main system. The Council adopted
    satisfactory measures of reform on neither of these methods. It contented itself with
    stipulations and concordats, guaranteeing special privileges to the Churches of the
    several nations. But in the following century it became manifest that the Teutonic
    races had declared for the method suggested by Hus; while the Latin races, in the
    Council of Trent, undertook a purgation of the Church upon the second of the two
    plans. The Reformation was the visible outcome of the one, the Counter-Reformation of
    the other method.</p>
    <p>The Council of Constance was thus important in <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> causing the recognition of a single Pope,
    and in ventilating the divergent theories upon which the question of reform was
    afterwards to be disputed. But perhaps the most significant fact it brought into
    relief was the new phase of political existence into which the European races had
    entered. Nationality, as the main principle of modern history, was now established;
    and the diplomatic relations of sovereigns as the representatives of peoples were
    shown to be of overwhelming weight. The visionary mediaeval polity of Emperor and
    Pope faded away before the vivid actuality of full-formed individual nations,
    federally connected, controlled by common but reciprocally hostile interests.<a
    name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18"
    class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
    <p>The Council of Basel, opened in 1431, was in appearance a continuation of the
    Council of Constance. But its method of procedure ran counter to the new direction
    which had been communicated to European federacy by the action of the Constance
    congress. There the votes had been taken by nations. At Basel they were taken by men,
    after the questions to be decided had been previously discussed by special
    congregations and committees deputed for preliminary deliberations. It soon appeared
    that the fathers of the Basel Council aimed at opposing a lawfully-elected Pope, and
    sought to assume the, administration of the Church into their own hands.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span></p>
    <p>Their struggle with Eugenius IV., their election of an antipope, Felix V., and
    their manifest tendency to substitute oligarchical for Papal tyranny in the Church,
    had the effect of bringing the conciliar principle itself into disfavor with the
    European powers. The first symptom of this repudiation of the Council by Europe was
    shown in the neutrality proclaimed by Germany. The attitude of other Courts and
    nations proved that the Western races were for the moment prepared to leave the Papal
    question open on the basis supplied by the Council of Constance.</p>
    <p>The result of this failure of the conciliar principle at Basel was that Nicholas
    V. inaugurated a new age for the Papacy in Rome. I have already described the chief
    features of the Papal government from his election to the death of Clement VII. It
    was a period of unexampled splendor for the Holy See, and of substantial temporal
    conquests. The second Council of Pisa, which began its sittings, in 1511 under French
    sanction and support, exercised no disastrous influence over the restored powers and
    prestige of the Papacy. On the contrary, it gave occasion for a counter-council, held
    at the Lateran under the auspices of Julius II. and Leo X., in which the Popes
    established several points of ecclesiastical discipline that were not without value
    to their successors. But the leaven which had been scattered by Wyclif and Hus, of
    which the Council of Constance had taken cognizance, but which had not been
    extirpated, was spreading in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
    id="page96"></a>{96}</span> Germany throughout this period. The Popes themselves were
    doing all in their power to propagate dissent and discontent. Well aware of the
    fierce light cast by the new learning they had helped to disseminate, upon the dark
    places of their own ecclesiastical administration, they still continued to raise
    money by the sale of pardons and indulgences, to bleed their Christian flocks by
    monstrous engines of taxation, and to offend the conscience of an intelligent
    generation by their example of ungodly living. The Reformation ran like wild-fire
    through the North. It grew daily more obvious that a new Council must be summoned for
    carrying out measures of internal reform, and for coping with the forces of
    belligerent Protestantism. When things had reached this point, Charles V. declared
    his earnest desire that the Pope should summon a General Council. Paul III. now
    showed in how true a sense he was the man of a transitional epoch. So long as
    possible he resisted, remembering to what straits his predecessors had been reduced
    by previous Councils, and being deeply conscious of scandals in his own domestic
    affairs which might expose him to the fate of a John XXIII. Reviewing the whole
    series of events which have next to be recorded, we are aware that Paul had no great
    cause for agitation. The Council he so much dreaded was destined to exalt his office,
    and to recombine the forces of Catholic Christendom under the absolute supremacy of
    his successors. The Inquisition and the Company <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span> of Jesus, both of which he sanctioned at
    this juncture, were to guard, extend, and corroborate that supreme authority. But
    this was by no means apparent in 1540. It is a character of all transitional periods
    that in them the cautious men regard past precedents of peril rather than sanguine
    expectations based on present chances. A hero, in such passes, goes to meet the
    danger armed with his own cause and courage. A genius divines the future, and
    interprets it, and through interpretation tries to govern it. Paul was neither a hero
    nor a man of genius. Yet he did as much as either could have done; and he did it in a
    temper which perhaps the hero and the genius could not have commanded. He sent
    Legates to publish the opening of a Council at Trent in the spring of 1545; and he
    resolved to work this Council on the principles of diplomatical conservatism,
    reserving for himself the power of watching events and of enlarging or restricting
    its efficiency as might seem best to him.<a name="FNanchor_19_19"
    id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> It is singular
    that the Council thus reluctantly conceded by Paul III. should, during its first
    sessions and while he yet reigned, have confirmed the dogmatic foundations of modern
    Catholicism, made reconciliation with the Teutonic Reformers impossible, and
    committed the secular powers which held with Rome to a policy that rendered the Papal
    supremacy incontestable.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Face to face with the burning
    question of the Protestant rebellion, the Tridentine fathers hastened to confirm the
    following articles. First, they declared that divine revelation was continuous in the
    Church of which the Pope was head; and that the chief written depository of this
    revelation&mdash;namely, the Scriptures&mdash;had no authority except in the version
    of the Vulgate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span></p>
    <p>Secondly, they condemned the doctrine of Justification by Faith, adding such
    theological qualifications and reservations as need not, at this distance of time,
    and on a point devoid of present actuality, be scrupulously entertained. Thirdly,
    they confirmed the efficacy and the binding authority of the Seven Sacraments. It is
    thus clear that, on points of dogma, the Council convened by Pope and Emperor
    committed Latin Christianity to a definite repudiation of the main articles for which
    Luther had contended. Each of these points they successively traversed, foreclosing
    every loophole for escape into accommodation. It was in large measure due to
    Caraffa's energy and ability that these results were attained.</p>
    <p>The method of procedure adopted by the Council, and the temper in which its
    business was conducted, were no less favorable to the Papacy than the authoritative
    sanction which it gave to dogmas. From the first, the presidency and right of
    initiative in its sessions were conceded to the Papal Legates; and it soon became
    customary to refer decrees, before they were promulgated, to his Holiness in Rome for
    approval. The decrees themselves were elaborated in three congregations, one
    appointed for theological questions, the second for reforms, the third for
    supervision and ratification. They were then proposed for discussion and acceptance
    in general sessions of the Council. Here each vote told; and as there was a standing
    majority of Italian prelates, it required but little dexterity to secure the passing
    of any measure upon which the Court of Rome <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
    id="page100"></a>{100}</span> insisted. The most formidable opposition to the Papal
    prerogatives during these manoeuvres proceeded from the Spanish bishops, who urged
    the introduction of reforms securing the independence of the episcopacy.</p>
    <p>We find a remarkable demonstration of Paul III.'s difficulties as Pope of the
    transition, in the fact that while the Council of Trent was waging this
    uncompromising war against Reformers, his dread of Charles V. compelled him to
    suspend its sessions, transfer it to Bologna, and declare himself the political ally
    of German Protestants. This transference took place in 1547. His Legates received
    orders to invent some decent excuse for a step which would certainly be resisted,
    since Bologna was a city altogether subject to the Holy See. The Legates, by the
    connivance of the physicians in Trent, managed to create a panic of contagious
    epidemic.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21"
    class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Charles had won victories which seemed to place Germany at
    his discretion. His preponderance in Italy was thereby dangerously augmented. Paul,
    following the precedents of policy in which he had been bred, thought it at this
    crisis necessary to subordinate ecclesiastical to temporal interests. He interrupted
    the proceedings of the Council in order to hamper the Emperor in Germany. He
    encouraged the Northern Protestants in order that he might maintain an open issue in
    the loins of his Spanish rival. Nothing could more delicately illustrate the
    compli<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>{101}</span> cations
    of European politics than the inverted attitude assumed by the Roman Pontiff in his
    dealings with a Catholic Emperor at this moment of time.<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
    id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>
    <p>The opposition of the Farnesi to Paul's scheme for restoring Parma to the Holy See
    in 1549, broke Paul III.'s health and spirits. He died on November 10, and was
    succeeded by the Cardinal Giovanni Maria del Monte, of whose reign little need be
    said. Julius III. removed the Council from Bologna to Trent in 1551, where it made
    some progress in questions touching the Eucharist and the administration of episcopal
    sees; but in the next year its sessions were suspended, owing to the disturbed state
    of Southern Germany and the presence of a Protestant army under Maurice of Saxony in
    the Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
    class="fnanchor">[23]</a> This Pope passed his time agreeably and innocently enough
    in the villa which he built near the Porta del Popolo. His relatives were invested
    with several petty fiefs&mdash;that of their birthplace, Monte Sansovino, by Cosimo
    de'Medici; that of Novara by the Emperor, and that of Camerino by the Church. The old
    methods of Papal nepotism were not as yet abandoned. His successor, Marcello<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>{102}</span> II., survived his
    elevation only three weeks; and in May 1555, Giovanni Pietro Caraffa was elected,
    with the title of Paul IV. We have already made the acquaintance of this Pope as a
    member of the Oratory of Divine Love, as a co-founder of the Theatines, as the
    organizer of the Roman Inquisition, and as a leader in the first sessions of the
    Tridentine Council. Paul IV. sprang from a high and puissant family of Naples. He was
    a man of fierce, impulsive and uncompromising temper, animated by two ruling
    passions&mdash;burning hatred for the Spaniards who were trampling on his native
    land, and ecclesiastical ambition intensified by rigid Catholic orthodoxy. The first
    act of his reign was a vain effort to expel the Spaniards from Italy by resorting to
    the old device of French assistance. The abdication of Charles V. had placed Philip
    II. on the throne of Spain, and the settlement whereby the Imperial crown passed to
    his brother Ferdinand had substituted a feeble for a powerful Emperor. But Philip's
    disengagement from the cares of Germany left him more at liberty to maintain his
    preponderance in Southern Europe. It was fortunate for Paul IV. that Philip was a
    bigoted Catholic and a superstitiously obedient son of the Church. These two
    potentates, who began to reign in the same year, were destined, after the settlement
    of their early quarrel, to lead and organize the Catholic Counter-Reformation. The
    Duke of Guise at the Pope's request marched a French army into Italy. Paul <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>{103}</span> raised a body of
    mercenaries, who were chiefly German Protestants<a name="FNanchor_24_24"
    id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; and
    opened negotiations with Soliman, entreating the Turk to make a descent on Sicily by
    sea. Into such a fantastically false position was the Chief of the Church, the most
    Catholic of all her Pontiffs, driven by his jealous patriotism. We seem to be
    transported back into the times of a Sixtus IV. or an Alexander VI. And in truth,
    Paul's reversion to the antiquated Guelf policy of his predecessors was an
    anachronism. That policy ceased to be efficient when Francis I. signed the Treaty of
    Cambray; the Church, too, had gradually assumed such a position that armed
    interference in the affairs of secular sovereigns was suicidal. This became so
    manifest that Paul's futile attack on Philip in 1556 may be reckoned the last war
    raised by a Pope. From it we date the commencement of a new system of Papal
    co-operation with Catholic powers.</p>
    <p>The Duke of Alva put the forces at his disposal in the Two Sicilies into motion,
    and advanced to meet the Duke of Guise. But while the campaign dragged on, Philip won
    the decisive battle of S. Quentin. The Guise hurried back to France, and Alva marched
    unresisted upon Rome. There was no reason why the Eternal City should not have been
    subjected to another siege and sack. The will was certainly not wanting in Alva to
    humiliate the Pope, who never spoke of Spaniards but as renegade<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>{104}</span> Jews, Marrani,
    heretics, and personifications of pride. Philip, however, wrote reminding his general
    that the date of his birth (1527) was that of Rome's calamity, and vowing that he
    would not signalize the first year of his reign by inflicting fresh miseries upon the
    capital of Christendom. Alva was ordered to make peace on terms both honorable and
    advantageous to his Holiness; since the King of Spain preferred to lose the rights of
    his own crown rather than to impair those of the Holy See in the least particular.
    Consequently, when Alva entered Rome in peaceful pomp, he did homage for his master
    to the Pope, who was generously willing to absolve him for his past offences. Paul
    IV. publicly exulted in the abasement of his conquerors, declaring that it would
    teach kings in future the obedience they owed to the Chief of the Church. But Alva
    did not conceal his discontent. It would have been better, he said, to have sent the
    Pope to sue for peace and pardon at Brussels, than to allow him to obtain the one and
    grant the other on these terms.</p>
    <p>Paul's ambition to expel the Spaniards from Italy exposed him to the worst abuses
    of that Papal nepotism which he had denounced in others. He judged it necessary to
    surround himself with trusty and powerful agents of his own kindred.<a
    name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"
    class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
    id="page105"></a>{105}</span></p>
    <p>With that view he raised one of his nephews, Carlo, to the Cardinalate, and
    bestowed on two others the principal fiefs of the Colonna family. The Colonnas were
    by tradition Ghibelline. This sufficed for depriving them of Palliano and Montebello.
    Carlo Caraffa, who obtained the scarlet, had lived a disreputable life which
    notoriously unfitted him for any ecclesiastical dignity. In the days of Sixtus and
    Alexander this would have been no bar to his promotion. But the Church was rapidly
    undergoing a change; and Carlo, complying with the hypocritical spirit of his age,
    found it convenient to affect a thorough reformation, and to make open show of
    penitence. Rome now presented the singular spectacle of an inquisitorial Pope,
    unimpeachable in moral conduct and zealous for Church reform, surrounded by nephews
    who were little better than Borgias. The Caraffas began to dream of principalities
    and scepters. It was their ambition to lay hold on Florence, where Cosimo de'Medici,
    as a pronounced ally of Spain, had gained the bitter hatred of their uncle. But their
    various misdoings, acts of violence and oppression, avarice and sensuality, gradually
    reached the ears of the Pope. In an assembly of the Inquisition, held in January
    1559, he cried aloud, 'Reform! reform! reform!' Cardinal Pacheco, a determined foe of
    the Caraffeschi, raised his voice, and said, 'Holy Father! reform must first begin
    with us.' Pallavicini adds the remark that Paul understood well who was meant by
    <i>us</i>. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>{106}</span>
    immediately retired to his apartments, instituted a searching inquiry into the
    conduct of his nephews, and, before the month was out, deprived them of all their
    offices and honors, and banished them from Rome. He would not hear a word in their
    defence; and when Cardinal Farnese endeavored to procure a mitigation of their
    sentence, he brutally replied, 'If Paul III. had shown the same justice, your father
    would not have been murdered and mutilated in the streets of Piacenza.' In open
    consistory, before the Cardinals and high officials of his realm, with tears
    streaming from his eyes, he exposed the evil life of his relatives, declared his
    abhorrence of them, and protested that he had dwelt in perfect ignorance of their
    crimes until that time. This scene recalls a similar occasion, when Alexander VI.
    bewailed himself aloud before his Cardinals after the murder of the Duke of Gandia by
    Cesare. But Alexander's repentance was momentary; his grief was that of a father for
    Absalom; his indignation gave way to paternal weakness for the fratricide. Paul,
    though his love for his relatives seems to have been fervent, never relaxed his first
    severity against them. They were buried in oblivion; no one uttered their names in
    the Pope's presence. The whole secular administration of the Papal States was
    changed; not an official kept his place. For the first time Rome was governed by
    ministers in no way related to the Holy Father.</p>
    <p>Paul now turned his attention, with the fiery <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page107" id="page107"></a>{107}</span> passion that distinguished him, to the
    reformation of ecclesiastical abuses. On his accession he had published a Bull
    declaring that this would be a principal object of his reign. Nor had he in the midst
    of other occupations forgotten his engagement. A Congregation specially appointed for
    examining, classifying, and remedying such abuses had been established. It was
    divided into three committees, consisting of eight Cardinals, fifteen prelates, and
    fifty men of learning. At the same time the Inquisition was rigorously maintained.
    Paul extended its jurisdiction, empowered it to use torture, and was constant in his
    attendance on its meetings and <i>autos da f&eacute;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_26"
    id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But now
    that his plans for the expulsion of the Spaniards had failed, and his nephews had
    been hurled from their high station into the dust, there remained no other interest
    to distract his mind. Every day witnessed the promulgation of some new edict touching
    monastic discipline, simony, sale of offices, collation to benefices, church ritual,
    performance of clerical duties, and appointment to ecclesiastical dignities. It was
    his favorite boast that there would be no need of a Council to restore the Church to
    purity, since he was doing it.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page108" id="page108"></a>{108}</span> And indeed his measures formed the
    nucleus of the Tridentine decrees upon this topic in the final sessions of the
    Council. Under this government Rome assumed an air of exemplary behavior which struck
    foreigners with mute astonishment. Cardinals were compelled to preach in their
    basilicas. The Pope himself, who was vain of his eloquence, preached. Gravity of
    manners, external signs of piety, a composed and contrite face, ostentation of
    orthodoxy by frequent confession and attendance at the Mass, became fashionable; and
    the Court adopted for its motto the <i>Si non caste tamen caute</i> of the
    Counter-Reformation.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Aretino, with his usual blackguardly
    pointedness of expression, has given a hint of what the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i>
    implied in the following satiric lines:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Carafla, ipocrita infingardo,<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">Che tien per coscienza spirituale<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">Quando si mette del pepe in sul cardo.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Paul IV. brought the first period of the transition to an end. There were no
    attempts at dislodging the Spaniard, no Papal wars, no tyranny of Papal nephews
    converted into feudal princes, after his days. He stamped Roman society with his own
    austere and bigoted religion. That he was in any sense a hypocrite is wholly out of
    the question. But he made Rome hypocritical, and by establishing the Inquisition on a
    firm basis, he introduced a reign of spiritual terror into Italy.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>{109}</span></p>
    <p>At his death the people rose in revolt, broke into the dungeons of the
    Inquisition, released the prisoners, and destroyed the archives. The Holy Office was
    restored, however; and its higher posts of trust soon came to be regarded as
    stepping-stones to the Pontifical dignity.</p>
    <p>The successor of Paul IV. was a man of very different quality and antecedents.
    Giovanni Angelo Medici sprang, not from the Florentine house of Medici, but from an
    obscure Lombard stem. His father acquired some wealth by farming the customs in
    Milan; and his eldest brother, Gian Giacomo, pushed his way to fame, fortune, and a
    title by piracy upon the lake of Como.<a name="FNanchor_29_29"
    id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Gian
    Giacomo established himself so securely in his robber fortress of Musso that he soon
    became a power to reckon with. He then entered the imperial service, was created
    Marquis of Marignano by the Duke of Milan, and married a lady of the Orsini house,
    the sister of the Duchess of Parma. At a subsequent period he succeeded in subduing
    Siena to the rule of Cosimo de'Medici, who then acknowledged a pretended
    consanguinity between the two families.<a name="FNanchor_30_30"
    id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The
    younger brother, Giovanni Angelo, had meanwhile been studying law, practising as a
    jurist, and following the Court at Rome in the place of prothonotary which, as <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> the custom then was,
    he purchased in 1527. Paul III. observed him, took him early into favor, and on the
    marriage of Gian Giacomo, advanced him to the Cardinalate. This was the man who
    assumed the title of Pius IV. on his election to the Papacy in 1559.</p>
    <p>Paul IV. hated Cardinal Medici, and drove him away from Rome. It is probable that
    this antipathy contributed something to Giovanni Angelo's elevation. Of humble
    Lombard blood, a jurist and a worldling, pacific in his policy, devoted to Spanish
    interests, cautious and conciliatory in the conduct of affairs, ignorant of theology
    and indifferent to niceties of discipline, Pius IV. was at all points the exact
    opposite of the fiery Neapolitan noble, the Inquisitor and fanatic, the haughty
    trampler upon kings, the armed antagonist of Alva, the brusque, impulsive autocrat,
    the purist of orthodoxy, who preceded him upon the Papal throne.<a
    name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31"
    class="fnanchor">[31]</a> His trusted counselor was Cardinal Morone, whom Paul had
    thrown into the dungeons of the Inquisition on a charge of favoring Lutheran
    opinions, and who was liberated by the rabble in their fury.<a name="FNanchor_32_32"
    id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>
    <p>This in itself was significant of the new <i>r&eacute;gime</i> which now began in
    Rome. Morone, like his master, understood that the Church could best be guided by
    diplomacy and arts of peace. The two together brought the Council of Trent to that
    conclusion which left an undisputed sovereignty in theological and ecclesiastical
    affairs to the Papacy. It would have been impossible for a man of Caraffa's stamp to
    achieve what these sagacious temporizers and adroit managers effected.</p>
    <p>Without advancing the same arrogant claims to spiritual supremacy as Paul had
    made, Pius was by no means a feeble Pontiff. He knew that the temper of the times
    demanded wise concessions; but he also knew how to win through these concessions the
    reality of power. It was he who initiated and firmly followed the policy of alliance
    between the Papacy and the Catholic sovereigns.<a name="FNanchor_33_33"
    id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Instead
    of asserting the interests of the Church in antagonism <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> to secular potentates, he undertook to
    prove that their interests were identical. Militant Protestantism threatened the
    civil no less than the ecclesiastical order. The episcopacy attempted to liberate
    itself from monarchical and pontifical authority alike. Pius proposed to the
    autocrats of Europe a compact for mutual defence, divesting the Holy See of some of
    its privileges, but requiring in return the recognition of its ecclesiastical
    absolutism. In all difficult negotiations he was wont to depend upon himself;
    treating his counselors as agents rather than as peers, and holding the threads of
    diplomacy in his own hands. Thus he was able to transact business as a sovereign with
    sovereigns, and came to terms with them by means of personal correspondence. The
    reconstruction of Catholic Christendom, which took visible shape in the decrees of
    the Tridentine Council, was actually settled in the Courts of Spain, Austria, France
    and Rome. The Fathers of the Council were the mouthpieces of royal and Papal
    cabinets. The Holy Ghost, to quote a profane satire of the time, reached Trent in the
    despatch-bags of couriers, in the sealed instructions issued to ambassadors and
    legates.</p>
    <p>We observe throughout the negotiations which crowned the policy of this Pope with
    success, the operation not only of a pacific and far-seeing character, but also of
    the temper of a lawyer. Pius drew up the Tridentine decrees as an able con<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>{113}</span> veyancer draws up a
    complicated deed, involving many trusts, recognizing conflicting rights, providing
    for distant contingencies. It was in fact the marriage contract of ecclesiastical and
    secular absolutism, by which the estates of Catholic Christendom were put in trust
    and settlement for posterity. In formulating its terms the Pope granted points to
    which an obstinate or warlike predecessor, a Julius II. or a Paul IV., would never
    have subscribed his signature. In purely theological matters, such as the concession
    of the chalice to the laity and the marriage of the clergy, he was even willing to
    yield more for the sake of peace than his Court and clergy would agree to. But for
    each point he gave, he demanded a substantial equivalent, and showed such address in
    bargaining, that Rome gained far more than it relinquished. When the contract had
    been drafted, he ratified it by a full and ready recognition, and lawyer-like was
    punctual in executing all the terms to which he pledged himself.</p>
    <p>We must credit Pius IV. with keen insight into the new conditions of Catholic
    Europe, and recognize him as the real founder of the modern as distinguished from the
    mediaeval Papacy. That transition which I have been describing in the present chapter
    remained uncertain in its issue up to his pontificate. Before his death the salvation
    of Catholicism, the integrity of the Catholic Church, the solidity of the Roman
    hierarchy, and the possibility of a vigorous Counter-Reformation were placed beyond
    all doubt.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> It is
    noticeable that these substantial successes were achieved, not by a religious
    fanatic, but by a jurist; not by a saint, but by a genial man of the world; not by
    force of intellect and will, but by adroitness; not by masterful authority, but by
    pliant diplomacy; not by forcing but by following the current of events. Since
    Gregory VII., no Pope had done so much as Pius IV. for bracing the ancient fabric of
    the Church and confirming the Papal prerogative. But what a difference there is
    between a Hildebrand and a Giovanni Angelo Medici! How Europe had changed, when a man
    of the latter's stamp was the right instrument of destiny for starting the
    weather-beaten ship of the Church upon a new and prosperous voyage.</p>
    <p>Pius IV. was greatly assisted in his work by circumstances, of which he knew how
    to avail himself. Had it not been for the renewed spiritual activity of Catholicism
    to which I have alluded in this chapter, he might not have been able to carry that
    work through. He took no interest in theology, and felt no sympathy for the
    Inquisition.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But he prudently left that
    institution alone to pursue its function of policing the ecclesiastical realm. The
    Jesuits rendered him important assistance by propagating their doctrine of passive
    obedience to Rome. Spain supported him with the massive strength of a nation Catholic
    to the core; and when the Spanish prelates gave him trouble, he could rely for aid
    upon <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span> the
    Spanish crown. His own independence, as a prudent man of business, uninfluenced by
    bigoted prejudices or partialities for any sect, enabled him to manipulate all
    resources at his disposal for the main object of uniting Catholicism and securing
    Papal supremacy. He was also fortunate in his family relations, having no occasion to
    complicate his policy by nepotism. One of the first acts of his reign had been to
    condemn four of the Caraffeschi&mdash;Cardinal Caraffa, the Duke of Palliano, Count
    Aliffe and Leonardo di Cardine&mdash;to death; and this act of justice ended forever
    the old forms of domestic ambition which had hampered the Popes of the Renaissance in
    their ecclesiastical designs. His brother, the Marquis of Marignano, died in 1555;
    and this event opened for him the path to the Papacy, which he would never have
    attained in the lifetime of so grasping and ambitious a man.<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
    id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> With his
    next brother, Augusto, who succeeded to the marquisate, he felt no sympathy.<a
    name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36"
    class="fnanchor">[36]</a> His nephew Federigo Borromeo died in youth. His other
    nephew, Carlo Borromeo, the sainted Archbishop of Milan, remained close to his person
    in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37"
    class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But Carlo Borromeo was a man who personified the new spirit
    of Catholicism. Sincerely pious, zealous for the faith, immaculate in conduct,
    unwearied in the discharge of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
    id="page116"></a>{116}</span> diocesan duties, charitable to the poor, devoted to the
    sick, he summed up all the virtues of the Counter-Reformation. Nor had he any of the
    virtues of the Renaissance. A Venetian Ambassador described him as cold of political
    temperament, little versed in worldly affairs, and perplexed when he attempted to
    handle matters of grave moment.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> His presence at the Papal Court, so
    far from being perilous, as that of an ambitious Cardinal Nipote would have been, or
    scandalous as that of former Riarios, Borgias, and Caraffas had undoubtedly been, was
    a source of strength to Pius. It imported into his immediate surroundings just what
    he himself lacked, and saved him from imputations of worldliness which in the altered
    temper of the Church might have proved inconvenient.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
    id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Truly,
    among all Pontiffs who have occupied St. Peter's Chair, Pius IV. deserved in the
    close of his life to be called fortunate. He had risen from obscurity, had entered
    Rome in humble office at the moment of Rome's deepest degradation. He had lived
    through troubled times, and for some years had felt the whole weight of Catholic
    concerns upon his shoulders. At the last, he was conscious of having opened a new era
    for the Church, and of being able to transmit a scepter of undisputed authority to
    his successors. His death-bed was troubled with no remorse, with no ingratitude of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span> relatives, with
    no political complications produced by family ambition or by the sacrifice of his
    official duties to personal aggrandizement.</p>
    <p>Soon after the election of Pope Pius IV. the state of Europe made the calling of a
    General Council indispensable. Paul's impolitic pretensions had finally alienated
    England from the Roman Church. Scotland was upon the point of declaring herself
    Protestant. The Huguenots were growing stronger every year in France, the Queen
    Mother, Catherine de'Medici, being at that time inclined to favor them. The
    Confession of Augsburg had long been recognized in Germany. The whole of Scandinavia,
    with Denmark, was lost to Catholicism. The Low Countries, in spite of Philip, Alva,
    and the Inquisition, remained intractable. Bohemia, Hungary, and Poland were
    alienated, ripe for open schism. The tenets of Zwingli had taken root in German
    Switzerland. Calvin was gaining ground in the French cantons. Geneva had become a
    stationary fortress, the stronghold of belligerent reformers, whence heresy sent
    forth its missionaries and promulgated subversive doctrines through the medium of an
    ever-active press. Transformed by Calvin from its earlier condition of a
    pleasure-loving and commercial city, it was now what Deceleia under Spartan
    discipline had been to Athens in the Peloponnesian war&mdash;a permanent
    <i>epiteichismos</i>, perpetually garrisoned and on guard to harry the flanks of
    Catholics. Faithful to the Roman See in a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
    id="page118"></a>{118}</span> strict sense of the term, there remained only Spain,
    Portugal, and Italy. As the events of the next century proved, the disaffected
    nations still offered rallying-points for the Catholic cause, from which the tide of
    conquest was rolled back upon the Reformation. But in 1559 the outlook for the Church
    was very gloomy; no one could predict whether a General Council might not increase
    her difficulties by weakening the Papal power and sowing further seeds of discord
    among her few faithful adherents. Yet Pius, after an attempt to combine the Catholic
    nations in a crusade against Geneva, which was frustrated by the jealousy of Spain,
    the internal weakness of France and the respect inspired by Switzerland,<a
    name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"
    class="fnanchor">[40]</a> determined to cast his fortunes on the Council. He had
    several strong points in his favor. The reigning Emperor, Ferdinand, wielded a power
    insignificant when compared with that of Charles V. The Protestants, though formally
    invited, were certain not to attend a Council which had already condemned the
    articles of their Confession. The cardinal dogmas of Catholicism had been confirmed
    in the sessions of 1545-1552. It was to be hoped that, with skillful management,
    existing differences of opinion with regard to doctrine, church-management, and
    reformation of abuses, might be settled to the satisfaction of the Catholic
    powers.</p>
    <p>The Pope accordingly sent four Legates, the Cardinals Gonzaga, Seripando,
    Simoneta, Hosius, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
    id="page119"></a>{119}</span> and Puteo, to Trent, who opened the Council on January
    15, 1562.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41"
    class="fnanchor">[41]</a> As had been anticipated, the Protestants showed strong
    disinclination to attend. The French prelates were unable to appear, pending
    negotiations with the Huguenots at Poissy and Pontoise. The German prelates intimated
    their reluctance to take part in the proceedings. The Court of France demanded that
    the chalice for the laity and the use of the vulgar tongue in religious services
    should be conceded. The Emperor also insisted on these points, making a further
    demand for the marriage of the clergy. Circumstances both in France and Germany
    seemed to render these conditions imperative, if the rapid spread of Protestant
    dissent were to be checked and the remnant of the Catholic population to be kept in
    obedience. Of ecclesiastics, only Spaniards and Italians, the latter in a large
    majority, appeared at Trent. The Courts of other nations were represented by
    ambassadors, who took no part in the deliberations of the Council.<a
    name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42"
    class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
    <p>In spite of this inauspicious commencement, Pius declared the Council a General
    Council, and further decreed that it should be recognized as a continuation <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>{120}</span> of that Council which
    had begun at Trent in 1545. This rendered co-operation of the Protestants impossible,
    since they would have been compelled to accept the earlier dogmatic resolutions of
    the Fathers. It was decided that no proxies should be allowed to absentees; that the
    questions of doctrine and reform should be prepared for discussion in two separate
    congregations, and should be taken into consideration in full sessions
    simultaneously; finally that the Papal Legates should alone have the privilege of
    proposing resolutions to the fathers. This last point, by which the Court of Rome
    reserved to itself the control of all proceedings in the Council, was carried by a
    clever ruse. Until too late the Spanish prelates do not seem to have been aware of
    the immense power they had conferred on Rome by passing the words <i>Legatis
    proponentibus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The principle involved in this
    phrase continued to be hotly disputed all through the sessions of the Council. But
    Pius knew that so long as he stuck fast to it he always held the ace of trumps, and
    nothing would induce him to relinquish it.</p>
    <p>Fortified in this position of superiority, Pius now proceeded to organize his
    forces and display his tactics. All through the sessions of the Council they remained
    the same; and as the method resulted in his final victory, it deserves to be briefly
    described. At any cost he determined to secure a numerical majority in the Synod.
    This was effected by drafting<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
    id="page121"></a>{121}</span> Italian prelates, as occasion required, to Trent. Many
    of the poorer sort were subsidized, and placed under the supervision of Cardinal
    Simoneta, who gave them orders how to vote. A small squadron of witty bishops was
    told off to throw ridicule on inconvenient speakers by satirical interpolations, or
    to hamper them by sophistical arguments. Spies were introduced into the opposite
    camps, who kept the Legates informed of what the French or Spaniards deliberated in
    their private meetings. The Legates meanwhile established a daily post of couriers,
    who carried the minutest details of the Council to the Vatican. When the resolutions
    of the congregations on which decrees were to be framed had been drawn up, they
    referred them to his Holiness. Without his sanction they did not propose them in a
    general session. In this fashion, by means of his standing majority, the exclusive
    right of his Legates to propose resolutions, and the previous reference of these
    resolutions to himself, Pius was enabled to direct the affairs of the Council. It
    soon became manifest that while the fathers were talking at Trent their final
    decisions were arranged in Rome. This not unnaturally caused much discontent. It
    began to be murmured that the Holy Ghost was sent from Rome to Trent in carpet-bags.
    A man of more imperious nature than Pius might, by straining his prerogatives, have
    produced an irreconcilable rupture. But he was aware that the very existence of the
    Papacy depended on circumspection. He therefore used all <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> his advantages with caution, and
    resolved to win the day by diplomacy. With this object in view he introduced the
    further system of negotiating with the Catholic Courts through special agents.
    Instead of framing the decrees upon the information furnished by his Legates, he in
    his turn submitted them to Philip, Catherine de'Medici, and Ferdinand, agreed on
    terms of mutual concession, persuaded the princes that their interests were identical
    with his own, and then returned such measures to the Council as could be safely
    passed. In course of time the Holy Ghost was not packed up at Rome for Trent in
    carpet-bags before he had gone round of Europe and made his bow in all cabinets.</p>
    <p>It must not, however, be thought that matters went smoothly for the Pope at first,
    or that so novel a method as that which I have described, whereby the faith and
    discipline of Christendom were settled by negotiations between sovereigns, came
    suddenly into existence. In its first sessions the Council, to quote the Pope's own
    words, resembled the Tower of Babel rather than a Synod of Fathers. The Spanish
    prelates contended fiercely for two principles touching the episcopacy: one was that
    the residence of bishops in their dioceses had been divinely commanded; the other,
    that their authority is derived from Christ immediately. The first struck at the
    Pope's power to dispense from the duty of residence; and if it had been established,
    it would have ruined <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
    id="page123"></a>{123}</span> his capital. The second would have rendered the
    episcopacy independent of Rome, and have made the Holy Father one of a numerous
    oligarchy instead of the absolute chief of a hierarchy. Pius was able to show Philip
    that the independence of the bishops must inflict deep injuries on the crown of
    Spain. Philip therefore wrote to forbid insistance on this point. But the Spanish
    prelates, though coerced, were not silenced, and the storm which they had raised went
    grumbling on.</p>
    <p>Difficulties of a no less serious nature arose when the French and Imperial
    ambassadors arrived at Trent in the spring. They demanded, as I have already stated,
    that the chalice should be conceded to the laity; nor is it easy to understand why
    this point might not have been granted. Pius himself was ready to make the
    concession; and the only valid argument against it was that it imperiled the
    uniformity of ritual throughout all Catholic countries. The Germans further
    stipulated for the marriage of the clergy, which the Pope was also disposed to
    entertain, until he reflected that celibacy alone retained the clergy faithful to his
    interests and regardless of those of their own nations. At this juncture of affairs,
    the Roman Court, which was strongly opposed to both concessions, received material
    aid from the dissensions of the Council. The Spaniards would hear nothing of the
    Eucharist under both forms. The marriage of the clergy was opposed by French and
    Spaniards alike. On the point of epis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
    id="page124"></a>{124}</span> copal independence, the French supported the Spaniards;
    but Pius used the same arguments in France which he had used in Spain, with similar
    success. Thus there was no agreement on any of the disputed questions between
    Spaniards, Frenchmen and Germans; and since the ambassadors could neither propose nor
    vote, and the Italian prelates were in a permanent majority, Pius was able to defer
    and temporize at leisure.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, he began to feel the gravity of the situation. He saw that the
    embassies constituted dangerous centers of intrigue and national organization at
    Trent. He was not entirely satisfied with his own Legate, the Cardinal Gonzaga, who
    supported the divine right of the episcopacy, and quarreled with his colleagues. The
    Spaniards, infuriated at having sacrificed the right of proposing measures, began to
    talk openly about the reform of the Papacy. Disagreeable messages reached Rome from
    France, and Spain, and Germany, complaining of the Pope's absolutism in Council, and
    demanding that the reform of the Church should be taken into serious and instant
    consideration. His devoted adherent, Lainez, General of the Jesuits, embittered
    opposition by passionately preaching the doctrine of passive obedience. Two dangers
    lay before him. One was that the Council should break up in confusion, with discredit
    to Rome, and anarchy for the Catholic Church. The other was that it should be
    prolonged in its dissensions by the princes, with a view of de<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>{125}</span> pressing and
    enfeebling the Papal authority. Other perils of an incalculable kind threatened him
    in the announced approach of the mighty Cardinal of Lorraine, brother to the Duke of
    Guise, with a retinue of French bishops released from the Conference at Poissy.
    Though he kept on packing the Council with fresh relays of Italians, it was much to
    be apprehended that they might be unable to oppose a coalition between French and
    Spanish prelates, should that be now effected.</p>
    <p>Pius, at this crisis, resolved on two important lines of policy, the energetic
    pursuit of which speedily brought the Council of Trent to a peaceful termination. The
    first was to meet the demand for a searching reformation of the Church with cheerful
    acquiescence; but to oppose a counter-demand that the secular States in all their
    ecclesiastical relations should at the same time be reformed. This implied a threat
    of alienating patronage and revenue from the princes; it also indicated plainly that
    the tiara and the crowns had interests in common. The second was to develop the
    diplomatic system upon which he had already tentatively entered.</p>
    <p>The events of the spring, 1563, hastened the adoption of these measures by the
    Pope. Cardinal Lorraine had arrived with his French bishops<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
    id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>; and the
    Papal Legates found themselves involved at <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
    id="page126"></a>{126}</span> once in intricate disputes on questions touching the
    Huguenots and the interests of the Gallican Church. The Italians were driven in
    despair to epigrams: <i>Dalla scabie Spagnuola siamo caduti nel mal Francese</i>.
    Somewhat later, the Emperor dispatched a bulky and verbose letter, announcing his
    intention to play the part which Sigismund had assumed at the Council of Constance.
    He complained roundly of the evils caused by the reference of all resolutions to
    Rome, by the exclusive rights of the Legates to propose decrees, and by the intrigues
    of the Italian majority in the Synod. He wound up by declaring that the reformation
    of the Church must be accomplished in Trent, not left to the judgment of the Papal
    Curia; and threatened to arrive from Innsbruck by the Brenner. Though Ferdinand was
    in a position of ecclesiastical and political weakness, such an Imperial rescript
    could not be altogether contemned; especially as Cardinal Lorraine, soon after his
    arrival, had made the journey to Innsbruck on purpose to confer with the Emperor. It
    therefore behoved the Pope to act with decision; and an important event happened in
    the first days of March, which materially assisted him in doing so. This was the
    death of Cardinal Gonzaga, whom Pius determined to replace by the moderate and
    circumspect Morone.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> Through
    Ippolito d'Este, Cardinal of Ferrara, he opened negotiations with the French Court,
    showing that the wishes of the prelates in the Council on the question of episcopacy
    were no less opposed to the crown than to his own interests. Cardinal Simoneta urged
    the same point on the Marquis of Pescara, who governed Milan for Philip, and was well
    inclined to the Papal party. Cardinal Morone was sent on a special embassy to the
    Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46"
    class="fnanchor">[46]</a> By wise concessions, in which the prerogatives of the
    Imperial ambassadors at Trent were considerably enlarged, and a searching reformation
    of the Church was promised, Morone succeeded in establishing a good working basis for
    the future. It came to be understood that while the Pope would allow no further
    freedom to the bishops, he was well disposed to let his Legates admit the envoys of
    the Catholic powers into their counsels. From this time forward the Synod may be said
    to have existed only as a mouthpiece for uttering the terms agreed on by the Pope and
    potentates. Morone returned to Trent, and the Emperor withdrew from Innsbruck toward
    the north.</p>
    <p>The difficulty with regard to France and Germany consisted in this, that politics
    forced both<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span> King
    and Emperor to consider the attitude of their Protestant subjects. Yet both alike
    were unable to maintain their position as Catholic sovereigns, if they came to open
    rupture with the Papacy. Ferdinand, as we have just seen, had expressed himself
    contented with the situation of affairs at Trent. But the French prelates still
    remained in opposition, and the French Court was undecided. Cardinal Morone, upon his
    arrival at Trent, began to flatter the Cardinal of Lorraine, affecting to take no
    measures of importance without consulting him. This conduct, together with timely
    compliments to several Frenchmen of importance, smoothed the way for future
    agreement; while the couriers who arrived from France, brought the assurance that
    Ippolito d'Este's representations had not been fruitless. Pius, meanwhile, was
    playing the same conciliatory game in Rome, where Don Luigi d'Avila arrived as a
    special envoy from Philip. The ambassador obtained a lodging in the Vatican, and was
    seen in daily social intercourse with his Holiness.<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
    id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> But the
    climax of this policy was reached when Lorraine accepted the Pope's invitation, and
    undertook a journey to Rome. This happened in September. The French Cardinal was
    pompously received, entertained in the palace, and honored with personal visits in
    his lodgings by the Pope. Weary of Trent and the tiresome intrigues of the<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>{129}</span> Council, this
    unscrupulous prelate was still further inclined to negotiation after the murder of
    his brother, Duke of Guise. It must be remembered that the Guises in France were
    after all but a potent faction of semi-royal adventurers, who had risen to eminence
    by an alliance with Diane de Poitiers. The murder of the duke shook the foundations
    of their power; and the Cardinal was naturally anxious to be back again in France.
    For the moment he basked in the indolent atmosphere of Rome, surrounded by those
    treasures of antique and Renaissance luxury which still remained after the Sack of
    1527. Pius held out flattering visions of succession to the Papacy, and proved
    convincingly that nothing could sustain the House of Guise or base the Catholic faith
    in France except alliance with the Papal See. Lorraine, who had probably seen enough
    of episcopal <i>canaillerie</i> in the Council, and felt his inner self expand in the
    rich climate of pontifical Rome, allowed his ambition to be caressed, confessed
    himself convinced, and returned to Trent intoxicated with his visit, the devoted
    friend of Rome.</p>
    <p>Menaces, meanwhile, had been astutely mingled with cajoleries. The French and the
    Imperial Courts were growing anxious on the subject of reform in secular
    establishments. Pius had threatened to raise the whole question of national Churches
    and the monarch's right of interfering in their administration. This was tantamount
    to flinging a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>{130}</span>
    burning torch into the powder-magazine of Huguenot and Lutheran grievances. In order
    to save themselves from the disaster of explosion, they urged harmonious action with
    the Papacy upon their envoys. The Spanish Court, through Pescara, De Luna, and
    D'Avalos, wrote dispatches of like tenor. It was now debated whether a congress of
    Crowned heads should not be held to terminate the Council in accordance with the
    Papal programme. This would have suited Pius. It was the point to which his policy
    had led. Yet no such measure could be lightly hazarded. A congress while the Council
    was yet sitting, would have been too palpable and cynical a declaration of the Papal
    game. As events showed, it was not even necessary. When Lorraine returned to Trent,
    the French opposition came to an end. The Spanish had been already neutralized by the
    firm persistent exhibition of Philip's will to work for Roman absolutism.<a
    name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"
    class="fnanchor">[48]</a> There was nothing left but to settle details, to formulate
    the terms of ecclesiastical reform, and to close the Council of Trent with a
    unanimous vote of confidence in his Holiness. The main outlines of dogma and
    discipline were quickly drawn. Numerous details were referred to the Pope for
    definition. The Council terminated in December <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page131" id="page131"></a>{131}</span> with an act of submission, which placed
    all its decrees at the pleasure of the Papal sanction. Pius was wise enough to pass
    and ratify the decrees of the Tridentine fathers by a Bull dated on December 26,
    1563, reserving to the Papal sovereign the sole right of interpreting them in
    doubtful or disputed cases. This he could well afford to do; for not an article had
    been penned without his concurrence, and not a stipulation had been made without a
    previous understanding with the Catholic powers. The very terms, moreover, by which
    his ratification was conveyed, secured his supremacy, and conferred upon his
    successors and himself the privileges of a court of ultimate appeal. At no previous
    period in the history of the Church had so wide, so undefined, and so unlimited an
    authority been accorded to the See of Rome. Thus Pius IV. was triumphant in obtaining
    conciliar sanction for Pontifical absolutism, and in maintaining the fabric of the
    Roman hierarchy unimpaired, the cardinal dogmas of Latin Christianity unimpeached and
    after formal inquisition reasserted in precise definitions. A formidable armory had
    been placed at the disposal of the Popes, who were fully empowered to use it, and who
    had two mighty engines for its application ready in the Holy Office and the Company
    of Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"
    class="fnanchor">[49]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"
    id="page132"></a>{132}</span></p>
    <p>After the termination of the Council there was nothing left for Pius but to die.
    He stood upon a pinnacle which might well have made him nervous&mdash;lest haply the
    Solonian maxim, 'Call no man fortunate until his death,' should be verified in his
    person. During the two years of peace and retirement which he had still to pass, the
    unsuccessful conspiracy of Benedetto Accolti and Antonio Canossa against his life
    gave point to this warning. But otherwise, withdrawn from cares of state, which he
    committed to his nephew, Carlo Borromeo, he enjoyed the tranquillity that follows
    successful labor, and sank with undiminished prestige into his grave <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>{133}</span> at the end of 1565.
    Those who believe in masterful and potent leaders of humanity may be puzzled to
    account for the triumph achieved by this common-place arbiter of destiny. Not by
    strength but by pliancy of character he accomplished the transition from the
    mediaeval to the modern epoch of Catholicism. He was no Cromwell, Frederick the
    Great, or Bismarck; only a politic old man, contriving by adroit avoidance to steer
    the ship of the Church clear through innumerable perils. This scion of the Italian
    middle class, this moral mediocrity, placed his successors in S. Peter's chair upon a
    throne of such supremacy that they began immediately to claim jurisdiction over kings
    and nations. Thirty-eight years before his death, when Clement VII. was shut up in S.
    Angelo, it seemed as though the Papal power might be abolished. Forty-five years
    after his death, Sarpi, writing to a friend in 1610, expressed his firm opinion that
    the one, the burning question for Europe was the Papal power.<a name="FNanchor_50_50"
    id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Through
    him, poor product as he was of ordinary Italian circumstances, elected to be Pope
    because of his easy-going mildness by prelates worn to death in fiery Caraffa's
    reign, it happened that the flood of Catholic reaction was rolled over Europe. In a
    certain sense we may therefore regard him as a veritable <i>Flagellum Dei</i>,
    wielded by inscrutable fate. It seems that at momentous epochs of world-history no
    hero is needed to effect the purpose of the Time-<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page134" id="page134"></a>{134}</span> Spirit. A Gian Angelo Medici, agreeable,
    diplomatic, benevolent, and pleasure-loving, sufficed to initiate a series of events
    which kept the Occidental races in perturbation through two centuries.</p>
    <p>A great step had been taken in the pontificate of Pius IV. That reform of the
    Church, which the success of Protestantism rendered necessary, and which the Catholic
    powers demanded, had been decreed by the Council of Trent. Pius showed no
    unwillingness to give effect to the Council's regulations; and the task was
    facilitated for him by his nephew, Carlo Borromeo, and the Jesuits. It still
    remained, however, to be seen whether a new Pope might not reverse the policy on
    which the Counter-Reformation had been founded, and impede the beneficial inner
    movement which was leading the Roman hierarchy into paths of sobriety. Should this
    have happened, it would have been impossible for Romanism to assume a warlike
    attitude of resistance toward the Protestants in Europe, or to have rallied its own
    spiritual forces. The next election was therefore a matter of grave import.</p>
    <p>Nothing is more remarkable in the history of the Papacy at this epoch than the
    singular contrast offered by each Pontiff in succession to his predecessor. The
    conclave was practically uncontrolled in its choice by any external force of the
    first magnitude. Though a Duke of Florence might now, by intrigue, determine the
    nomination of a Pius IV., no commanding Emperor or King of France, as in <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> the times of Otto the
    Great or Philip le Bel, could designate his own candidate. There was no strife, so
    open as in the Renaissance period, between Cardinals subsidized by Spain or Austria
    or France.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51"
    class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The result was that the deliberations of the conclave were
    determined by motives of petty interests, personal jealousies, and local
    considerations, to such an extent that the election seemed finally to be the result
    of chance or inspiration. We find the most unlikely candidates, Caraffa and Peretti,
    attributing their elevation to the direct influence of the Holy Ghost, in the
    consciousness that they had slipped into S. Peter's Chair by the maladroitness of
    conflicting factions. The upshot, however, of these uninfluenced elections generally
    was to promote a man antagonistic to his predecessor. The clash of parties and the
    numerical majority of independent Cardinals excluded the creatures of the last reign,
    and selected for advancement one who owed his position to the favor of an antecedent
    Pontiff. This result was further secured by the natural desire of all concerned in
    the election to nominate an old man, since it was for the general advantage that a
    pontificate should, if possible, not exceed five years.</p>
    <p>The personal qualities of Carlo Borromeo were <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page136" id="page136"></a>{136}</span> of grave importance in the election of a
    successor to his uncle. He had ruled the Church during the last years of Pius IV.;
    and the newly-appointed Cardinals were his dependents. Had he attempted to exert his
    power for his own election, he might have met with opposition. He chose to use it for
    what he considered the deepest Catholic interests. This unselfishness led to the
    selection of a man, Michele Ghislieri, whose antecedents rendered him formidable to
    the still corrupt members of the Roman hierarchy, but whose character was precisely
    of the stamp required for giving solidity to the new phase on which the Church had
    entered. As Pius IV. had been the exact opposite to Paul IV., so Pius V. was a
    complete contrast to Pius IV. He had passed the best years of his life as chief of
    the Inquisition. Devoted to theology and to religious exercises, he lacked the legal
    and mundane faculties of his predecessor. But these were no longer necessary. They
    had done their duty in bringing the Council to a favorable close, and in establishing
    the Catholic concordat. What was now required was a Pope who should, by personal
    example and rigid discipline, impress Rome with the principles of orthodoxy and
    reform. Carlo Borromeo, self-conscious, perhaps, of the political incapacity which
    others noticed in him, and fervently zealous for the Catholic Revival, devolved this
    duty on Michele Ghislieri, who completed the work of his two predecessors.</p>
    <p>Paul IV. had laid a basis for the modern Roman<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page137" id="page137"></a>{137}</span> Church by strengthening the Inquisition
    and setting internal reforms on foot. Pius IV., externally, by his settlement of the
    Tridentine Council, and by the establishment of the Catholic concordat, built upon
    this basis an edifice which was not as yet massive. Carlo Borromeo and the Jesuits
    during the last pontificate prepared the way for a Pope who should cement and gird
    that building, so that it should be capable of resisting the inroads of time and
    should serve as a fortress of attack on heresy. That Pope was Michele Ghislieri, who
    assumed the title of Pius V. in 1566.</p>
    <p>Before entering on the matter of his reign, it will be necessary to review the
    state of Rome at this moment in the epoch of transition, when the mediaeval and
    Renaissance phases were fast merging into the phase of the Counter-Reformation. Old
    abuses which have once struck a deep root in any institution, die slowly. It is
    therefore desirable to survey the position in which the Papal Sovereign of the Holy
    City, as constituted by the Council of Trent, held sway there.</p>
    <p>The population of Rome was singularly fluctuating. Being principally composed of
    ecclesiastics with their households and dependents; foreigners resident in the city
    as suitors or ambassadors; merchants, tradespeople and artists attracted by the hope
    of gain; it rose or fell according to the qualities of the reigning Pope, and the
    greater or less train of life which happened to be fashionable. Noble <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> families were rather
    conspicuous by their absence than by their presence; for those of the first rank,
    Colonna and Orsini, dwelt upon their fiefs, and visited the capital only as occasion
    served. The minor aristocracy which gave solidity to social relations in towns like
    Florence and Bologna, never attained the rank of a substantial oligarchy in Rome. Nor
    was there an established dynasty round which a circle of peers might gather in
    permanent alliance with the Court. On the other hand, the frequent succession of
    Pontiffs chosen from various districts encouraged the growth of an ephemeral
    nobility, who battened for a while upon the favor of their Papal kinsmen, flooded the
    city with retainers from their province, and disappeared upon the election of a new
    Pope, to make room for another flying squadron. Instead of a group of ancient Houses,
    intermarrying and transmitting hereditary rights and honors to their posterity, Rome
    presented the spectacle of numerous celibate establishments, displaying great pomp,
    it is true, but dispersing and disappearing upon the decease of the patrons who
    assembled them. The households of wealthy Cardinals were formed upon the scale of
    princely Courts. Yet no one, whether he depended on the mightiest or the feeblest
    prelate, could reckon on the tenure of his place beyond the lifetime of his master.
    Many reasons, again&mdash;among which may be reckoned the hostility of reigning
    Pontiffs to the creatures of their predecessors or to their old rivals in the
    conclave&mdash;caused <span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
    id="page139"></a>{139}</span> the residence of the chief ecclesiastics in Rome to be
    precarious. Thus the upper stratum of society was always in a state of flux, its
    elements shifting according to laws of chronic uncertainty. Beneath it spread a
    rabble of inferior and dubious gentlefolk, living in idleness upon the favor of the
    Court, serving the Cardinals and Bishops in immoral and dishonest offices, selling
    their wives, their daughters and themselves, all eager to rise by indirect means to
    places of emolument.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Lower down, existed the
    <i>bourgeoisie</i> of artists, bankers, builders, shopkeepers, and artisans; and at
    the bottom of the scale came hordes of beggars. Rome, like all Holy Cities,
    entertained multitudes of eleemosynary paupers. Gregory XIII. is praised for having
    spent more than 200,000 crowns a year on works of charity, and for having assigned
    the district of San Sisto (in the neighborhood of Trinit&agrave; del Monte, one of
    the best quarters of the present city) to the beggars.<a name="FNanchor_53_53"
    id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>
    <p>Such being the social conditions of Rome, it is not surprising to learn that
    during the reign of so harsh a Pontiff as Paul IV., the population sank to a number
    estimated at between 40,000 and 50,000. It rose rapidly to 70,000, and touched 80,000
    in the reign of Pius IV. Afterwards it gradually ascended to 90,000, and during the
    popular pontificate of Gregory XIII. it is said to have reached the high <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>{140}</span> figure of 140,000.
    These calculations are based upon the reports of the Venetian ambassadors, and can be
    considered as impartial, although they may not be statistically exact.<a
    name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"
    class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>
    <p>What rendered Roman society rotten to the core was universal pecuniary corruption.
    In Rome nothing could be had without payment; but men with money in their purse
    obtained whatever they desired. The office of the Datatario alone brought from ten to
    fourteen thousand crowns a month into the Papal treasury in 1560.<a
    name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55"
    class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This large sum accrued from the composition of benefices
    and the sale of vacant offices. The Camera Apostolica, or Chamber of Justice, was no
    less venal. A price was set on every crime, for which its punishment could be
    commuted into cash-payment. Even so severe a Pope as Paul IV. committed to his
    nephew, by published and printed edict, the privilege of compounding with criminals
    by fines.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"
    class="fnanchor">[56]</a> One consequence of this vile system, rightly called by the
    Venetian envoy 'the very strangest that could be witnessed or heard of in such
    matters,' was that wealthy sinners indulged their appetites at the expense of their
    families, and that innocent people became the prey of sharpers and informers.<a
    name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
    class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Rome had organized a vast system of <i>chantage</i>. <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>{141}</span> Another consequence
    was that acts of violence were frightfully common. Men could be hired to commit
    murders at sums varying from ten to four scudi; and on the death of Paul IV., when
    anarchy prevailed for a short while in Rome, an eye-witness asserts that several
    hundred assassinations were committed within the walls in a few days.<a
    name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"
    class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
    <p>It was not to be expected that a population so corrupt, accustomed for generations
    to fatten upon the venality and vices of the hierarchy, should welcome those radical
    reforms which were the best fruits of the Tridentine Council. They specially disliked
    the decrees which enforced the residence of prelates and the limitation of benefices
    held by a single ecclesiastic. These regulations implied the withdrawal of wealthy
    patrons from Rome, together with an incalculable reduction in the amount of foreign
    money spent there. Nor were the measures for abolishing a simoniacal sale of offices,
    and the growing demand for decency in the administration of justice, less unpopular.
    The one struck at the root of private speculation in lucrative posts, and deprived
    the Court of revenues which had to be replaced by taxes. The other destroyed the arts
    of informers, checked lawlessness and license in the rich, and had the same
    lamentable effect of impoverishing the Papal treasury. In proportion as the Curia
    ceased to subsist upon the profits of simony, superstition, and sin, it was forced to
    main<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>{142}</span> tain itself
    by imposts on the people, and by resuming, as Gregory XIII. attempted to do, its
    obsolete rights over fiefs and lands accorded on easy terms or held by doubtful
    titles. Meanwhile the retrenchment rendered necessary in all households of the
    hierarchy, and the introduction of severer manners, threatened many minor branches of
    industry with extinction.</p>
    <p>These changes began to manifest themselves during the pontificate of Pius IV. The
    Pope himself was inclined to a liberal and joyous scale of living. But he was not
    remarkable for generosity; and the new severity of manners made itself felt by the
    example of his nephew Carlo Borromeo&mdash;a man who, while living in the purple,
    practiced austerities that were apparent in his emaciated countenance. The Jesuits
    ruled him; and, through him, their influence was felt in every quarter of the city.<a
    name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"
    class="fnanchor">[59]</a> 'The Court of Rome,' says the Venetian envoy in the year
    1565, 'is no longer what it used to be either in the quality or the numbers of the
    courtiers. This is principally due to the poverty of the Cardinals and the parsimony
    of the Popes. In the old days, when they gave away more liberally, men of ability
    flocked from all quarters. This reduction of the Court dates from the Council; for
    the bishops and beneficed clergy being now obliged to retire to their residences, the
    larger portion of the Court has left Rome. To the same cause may be <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>{143}</span> ascribed a diminution
    in the numbers of those who serve the Pontiff, seeing that since only one benefice
    can now be given, and that involves residence, there are few who care to follow the
    Court at their own expense and inconvenience without hope of greater reward. The
    poverty of the Cardinals springs from two causes. The first is that they cannot now
    obtain benefices of the first class, as was the case when England, Germany, and other
    provinces were subject to the Holy See, and when moreover they could hold three or
    four bishoprics apiece together with other places of emolument, whereas they now can
    only have one apiece. The second cause is that the number of the Cardinals has been
    increased to seventy-five, and that the foreign powers have ceased to compliment them
    with large presents and Benefices, as was the wont of Charles V. and the French
    crown.' In the last of these clauses we find clearly indicated one of the main
    results of the concordat established between the Papacy and the Catholic sovereigns
    by the policy of Pius IV. It secured Papal absolutism at the expense of the college.
    Soranzo proceeds to describe the changes visible in Roman society. 'The train of life
    at Court is therefore mean, partly through poverty, but also owing to the good
    example of Cardinal Borromeo, seeing that people are wont to follow the manners of
    their princes. The Cardinal holds in his hands all the threads of the administration;
    and living religiously in the retirement I have noticed, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page144" id="page144"></a>{144}</span> indulging in liberalities to none but
    persons of his own stamp, there is neither Cardinal nor courtier who can expect any
    favor from him unless he conform in fact or in appearance to his mode of life.
    Consequently one observes that they have altogether withdrawn, in public at any rate,
    from every sort of pleasures. One sees no longer Cardinals in masquerade or on
    horseback, nor driving with women about Rome for pastime, as the custom was of late;
    but the utmost they do is to go alone in close coaches. Banquets, diversions, hunting
    parties, splendid liveries and all the other signs of outward luxury have been
    abolished; the more so that now there is at Court no layman of high quality, as
    formerly when the Pope had many of his relatives or dependents around him. The clergy
    always wear their robes, so that the reform of the Church is manifested in their
    appearance. This state of things, on the other hand, has been the ruin of the
    artisans and merchants, since no money circulates. And while all offices and
    magistracies are in the hands of Milanese, grasping and illiberal persons, very few
    indeed can be still called satisfied with the present reign.'<a name="FNanchor_60_60"
    id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
    <p>One chief defect of Pius IV., judged by the standard of the new party in the
    Church, had been his coldness in religious exercises. Paolo Tiepolo remarks that
    during the last seven months of his life he never once attended service in his
    chapel.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
    class="fnanchor">[61]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"

    <p>This indifference was combined with lukewarmness in the prosecution of reforms.
    The Datatario still enriched itself by the composition of benefices, and the Camera
    by the composition of crimes. Pius V., on the contrary, embodied in himself those
    ascetic virtues which Carlo Borromeo and the Jesuits were determined to propagate
    throughout the Catholic world. He never missed a day's attendance on the prescribed
    services of the Church, said frequent Masses, fasted at regular intervals, and
    continued to wear the coarse woolen shirt which formed a part of his friar's costume.
    In his piety there was no hypocrisy. The people saw streams of tears pouring from the
    eyes of the Pontiff bowed in ecstacy before the Host. A rigid reformation of the
    churches, monasteries, and clergy was immediately set on foot throughout the Papal
    States. Monks and nuns complained, not without cause, that austerities were expected
    from them which were not included in the rules to which they vowed obedience. The
    severity of the Inquisition was augmented, and the Index Expurgatorius began to
    exercise a stricter jurisdiction over books. The Pope spent half his time at the Holy
    Office, inquiring into cases of heresy of ten or twenty years' standing. From
    Florence he caused Carnesecchi to be dragged to Rome and burned; from Venice the
    refugee Guido Zanetti of Fano was delivered over to his tender mercies; and the
    excellent Carranza, Archbishop of Toledo, was sent from Spain to be condemned to
    death before the Roman <span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"
    id="page146"></a>{146}</span> tribunal. Criminal justice, meanwhile, was administered
    with greater purity, and the composition of crimes for money, if not wholly
    abolished, was moderated. In the collation to bishoprics and other benefices the same
    spirit of equity appeared; for Pius inquired scrupulously into the character and
    fitness of aspirants after office.</p>
    <p>The zeal manifested by Pius V. for a thorough-going reform of manners may be
    illustrated by a curious circumstance related by the Venetian ambassador in the first
    year of the pontificate.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> On July 26, 1566, an edict was
    issued, compelling all prostitutes to leave Rome within six days, and to evacuate the
    States of the Church within twelve days. The exodus began. But it was estimated that
    about 25,000 persons, counting the women themselves with their hangers-on and
    dependents, would have to quit the city if the edict were enforced.<a
    name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63"
    class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The farmers of the customs calculated that they would lose
    some 20,000 ducats a year in consequence, and prayed the Pope for compensation.
    Meanwhile the roads across the Campagna began to be thronged by caravans, which were
    exposed to the attacks of robbers. The confusion became so great, and the public
    discontent was so openly expressed, that on August 17 Pius repealed <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> his edict and
    permitted the prostitutes to reside in certain quarters of the city.</p>
    <p>Pius IV. had wasted the greater part of his later life in bed, neglecting
    business, entertaining his leisure with buffoons and good companions, eating much and
    drinking more. Pius V., on the contrary, carried the habits of the convent with him
    into the Vatican, and bestowed the time he spared from devotion upon the transaction
    of affairs. He was of choleric complexion, adust, lean, wasted, with sunken eyes and
    snow-white hair, looking ten years older than he really was.</p>
    <p>Such a Pope changed the face of Rome, or rather stereotyped the change which had
    been instituted by Cardinal Borromeo. 'People, even if they are not really better,
    seem at least to be so,' says the Venetian envoy, who has supplied me with the
    details I have condensed.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Retrenchments in the Papal
    establishment were introduced; money was scarce; the Court grew meaner in appearance;
    and nepotism may be said to have been extinct in the days of Pius V. He did indeed
    advance one nephew, Michele Bonelli, to the Cardinalate; but he showed no inclination
    to enrich or favor him beyond due measure. A worn man, without ears, marked by the
    bastinado, frequented the palace, and stood near the person of the Pope, as Captain
    of the Guard. This was Paolo Ghislieri, a somewhat distant relative of Pius, who had
    passed his life in servitude to Bar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"
    id="page148"></a>{148}</span> bary corsairs and had been ransomed by a merchant upon
    the election of his kinsman. No other members of the Papal family were invited to
    Rome.</p>
    <p>Pius V., while living this exemplary monastic life upon the Papal throne, ruled
    Catholic Christendom more absolutely than any of his predecessors. As the Papacy
    recognized its dependence on the sovereigns, so the sovereigns in their turn
    perceived that religious conformity was the best safeguard of their secular
    authority. Therefore the Catholic States subscribed, one after the other, to the
    Tridentive Profession of Faith, and adopted one system in matters of Church
    discipline. A new Breviary and a new Missal were published with the Papal sanction.
    Seminaries were established for the education of ecclesiastics, and the Jesuits
    labored in their propaganda. The Inquisition and the Congregation of the Index
    redoubled their efforts to stamp out heresy by fire and iron, and by the suppression
    or mutilation of books. A rigid uniformity was impressed on Catholicism. The Pope, to
    whom such power had been committed by the Council, stood at the head of each section
    and department of the new organization. To his approval every measure in the Church
    was referred, and the Jesuits executed his instructions with punctual exactness.</p>
    <p>It is not, therefore, to be wondered that Pius V. should have opened the era of
    active hostilities against Protestantism. Firmly allied with Philip II., he advocated
    attacks upon the Huguenots in France, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
    id="page149"></a>{149}</span> the Protestants in Flanders, and the English crown.
    There is no evidence that he was active in promoting the Massacre of S. Bartholomew,
    which took place three months after his death; and the expedition of the Invincible
    Armada against England was not equipped until another period of fifteen years had
    elapsed. Yet the negotiations in which he was engaged with Spain, involving
    enterprises to the detriment of the English realm and the French Reformation, leave
    no doubt that both S. Bartholomew and the Armada would have met with his hearty
    approval. One glorious victory gave luster to the reign of Pius V. In 1571 the navies
    of Spain, Venice and Rome inflicted a paralyzing blow upon the Turkish power at
    Lepanto; and this success was potent in fanning the flame of Catholic enthusiasm.</p>
    <p>The pontificates of Paul IV., Pius IV., and Pius V., differing as they did in very
    important details, had achieved a solid triumph for reformed Catholicism, of which
    both the diplomatical and the ascetic parties in the Church, Jesuits and Theatines,
    were eager to take advantage. A new spirit in the Roman polity prevailed, upon the
    reality of which its future force depended; and the men who embodied this spirit had
    no mind to relax their hold on its administration. After the death of Pius V. they
    had to deal with a Pope who resembled his penultimate predecessor, Pius IV., more
    than the last Pontiff. Ugo Buoncompagno, the scion of a <i>bourgeois</i> family
    settled in Bologna, began his career as a jurist.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page150" id="page150"></a>{150}</span> He took orders in middle life, was
    promoted to the Cardinalate, and attained the supreme honor of the Holy See in 1572.
    The man responded to his name. He was a good companion, easy of access, genial in
    manners, remarkable for the facility with which he cast off care and gave himself to
    sanguine expectations.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> In an earlier period of Church
    history he might have reproduced the Papacy of Paul II. or Innocent VIII. As it was,
    Gregory XIII. fell at once under the potent influence of Jesuit directors. His
    confessor, the Spanish Francesco da Toledo, impressed upon him the necessity of
    following the footsteps of Paul IV. and Pius V. It was made plain that he must
    conform to the new tendencies of the Catholic Church; and in his neophyte's zeal he
    determined to outdo his predecessors. The example of Pius V. was not only imitated,
    but surpassed. Gregory XIII. celebrated three Masses a week, built churches, and
    enforced parochial obedience throughout his capital. The Jesuits in his reign
    attained to the maximum of their wealth and influence. Rome, 'abandoning her ancient
    license, displayed a moderate and Christian mode of living: and in so far as the
    external observance of religion was concerned, she showed herself not far removed
    from such perfection as human frailties allow.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66"
    id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
    <p>While he was yet a layman, Gregory became the father of one son, Giacomo. Born out
    of wedlock, he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span>
    was yet acknowledged as a member of the Buoncompagno family, and admitted under this
    name into the Venetian nobility.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The Pope manifested paternal
    weakness in favor of his offspring. He brought the young man to Rome, and made him
    Governatore di Santa Chiesa with a salary of 10,000 ducats. The Jesuits and other
    spiritual persons scented danger. They persuaded the Holy Father that conscience and
    honor required the alienation of his bastard from the sacred city. Giacomo was
    relegated to honorable exile in Ancona. But he suffered so severely from this rebuff,
    that terms of accommodation were agreed on. Giacomo received a lady of the Sforza
    family in marriage, and was established at the Papal Court with a revenue amounting
    to about 25,000 crowns.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The ecclesiastical party now
    predominant in Rome, took care that he should not acquire more than honorary
    importance in the government. Two of the Pope's nephews were promoted to the
    Cardinalate with provisions of about 10,000 crowns apiece. His old brother abode in
    retirement at Bologna under strict orders not to seek fortune or to perplex the Papal
    purity of rule in Rome.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
    <p>I have introduced this sketch of Gregory's relations in order to show how a Pope
    of his previous <span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span>
    habits and personal proclivities was now obliged to follow the new order of the
    Church. It was noticed that the mode of life in Rome during his reign struck a just
    balance between license and austerity, and that general satisfaction pervaded
    society.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70"
    class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Outside the city this contentment did not prevail. Gregory
    threw his States into disorder by reviving obsolete rights of the Church over lands
    mortgaged or granted with obscure titles. The petty barons rose in revolt, armed
    their peasants, fomented factions in the country towns, and filled the land with
    brigands. Under the leadership of men like Alfonso Piccolomini and Roberto Malatesta,
    these marauding bands assumed the proportion of armies. The neighboring Italian
    States&mdash;Tuscany, Venice, Naples, Parma, all of whom had found the Pope arbitrary
    and aggressive in his dealings with them&mdash;encouraged the bandits by offering
    them an asylum and refusing to co-operate with Gregory for their reduction.</p>
    <p>His successor, Sixtus V., found the whole Papal dominion in confusion. It was
    impossible to collect the taxes. Life and property were nowhere safe. By a series of
    savage enactments and stern acts of justice, Sixtus swept the brigands from his
    States. He then applied his powerful will to the collection of money and the
    improvement of his provinces. In the four years which followed his election he
    succeeded in accumulating a round sum of four million <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page153" id="page153"></a>{153}</span> crowns, which he stored up in the Castle
    of S. Angelo. The total revenues of the Papacy at this epoch were roughly estimated
    at 750,000 crowns, which in former reigns had been absorbed in current costs and the
    pontifical establishment. By rigorous economy and retrenchments of all kinds Sixtus
    reduced these annual expenses to a sum of 250,000, thus making a clear profit of
    500,000 crowns.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> At the same time he had already
    spent about a million and a half on works of public utility, including the famous
    Acqua Felice, which brought excellent water into Rome. Roads and bridges throughout
    the States of the Church were repaired, The Chiana of Orvieto and the Pontine Marsh
    were drained. Encouragement was extended, not only to agriculture, but also to
    industries and manufactures. The country towns obtained wise financial concessions,
    and the unpopular resumption of lapsed lands and fiefs was discontinued. Rome
    meanwhile began to assume her present aspect as a city, by the extensive
    architectural undertakings which Sixtus set on foot. He loved building; but he was no
    lover of antiquity. For pagan monuments of art he showed a monastic animosity,
    dispersing or mutilating the statues of the Vatican and Capitol; turning a Minerva
    into an image of the Faith by putting a cross in her hand; surmounting the columns of
    Trajan and Antonine with figures of Peter and Paul; destroying the Septizonium of
    Severus, and wishing to lay sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
    id="page154"></a>{154}</span> legious hands on Caecilia Metella's tomb. To mediaeval
    relics he was hardly less indifferent. The old buildings of the Lateran were thrown
    down to make room for the heavy modern palace. But, to atone in some measure for
    these acts of vandalism, Sixtus placed the cupola upon S. Peter's and raised the
    obelisk in the great piazza which was destined to be circled with Bernini's
    colonnades. This obelisk he tapped with a cross. Christian inscriptions, signalizing
    the triumph of the Pontiff over infidel emperors, the victory of Calvary over
    Olympus, the superiority of Rome's saints and martyrs to Rome's old deities and
    heroes, left no doubt that what remained of the imperial city had been subdued to
    Christ and purged of paganism. Wandering through Rome at the present time, we feel in
    every part the spirit of the Catholic Revival, and murmur to ourselves those lines of
    Clough:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>O ye mighty and strange, ye ancient divine ones of Hellas!<br />
        </span> <span>Are ye Christian too? To convert and redeem and renew you,<br />
        </span> <span>Will the brief form have sufficed, that a Pope has sat up on the
        apex<br />
        </span> <span>Of the Egyptian stone that o'ertops you, the Christian
        symbol?<br />
        </span> <span>And ye, silent, supreme in serene and victorious marble,<br />

        </span> <span>Are ye also baptized; are ye of the Kingdom of Heaven?<br />
        </span> <span>Utter, O some one, the word that shall reconcile Ancient and
        Modern.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Nothing was more absent from the mind of Sixtus than any attempt to reconcile
    Ancient and Modern. He was bent on proclaiming the ultimate triumph of Catholicism,
    not only over antiquity, but also over the Renaissance. His inscriptions, crosses,
    and images of saints are the enduring badges of serf<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page155" id="page155"></a>{155}</span> dom set upon the monuments of ancient
    and renascent Italy, bearing which they were permitted by the now absolute Pontiff to
    remain as testimonies to his power.</p>
    <p>Retrenchment alone could not have sufficed for the accumulation of so much idle
    capital, and for so extensive an expenditure on works of public utility. Sixtus
    therefore had recourse to new taxation, new loans, and the creation of new offices
    for sale. The Venetian envoy mentions eighteen imposts levied in his reign; a sum of
    600,000 crowns accruing to the Camera by the sale of places; and extensive loans, or
    Monti, which were principally financed by the Genoese.<a name="FNanchor_72_72"
    id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It was
    necessary for the Papacy, now that it had relinquished the larger part of its
    revenues derived from Europe, to live upon the proceeds of the Papal States. The
    complicated financial expedients on which successive Popes relied for developing
    their exchequer, have been elaborately explained by Ranke.<a name="FNanchor_73_73"
    id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> They were
    materially assisted in their efforts to support the Papal dignity upon the resources
    of their realm, by the new system of nepotism which now began to prevail. Since the
    Council of Trent, it was impossible for a Pope to acknowledge his sons, and few, if
    any, of the Popes after Pius IV. had sons to acknowledge.<a name="FNanchor_74_74"
    id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a><span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>{156}</span></p>
    <p>The tendencies of the Church rendered it also incompatible with the Papal position
    that near relatives of the Pontiff should be advanced, as formerly, to the dignity of
    independent princes. The custom was to create one nephew Cardinal, with such wealth
    derived from office as should enable him to benefit the Papal family at large.
    Another nephew was usually ennobled, endowed with capital in the public funds for the
    purchase of lands, and provided with lucrative places in the secular administration.
    He then married into a Roman family of wealth and founded one of the aristocratic
    houses of the Roman State. We possess some details respecting the incomes of the
    Papal nephews at this period, which may be of interest.<a name="FNanchor_75_75"
    id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Carlo
    Borromeo was reasonably believed to enjoy revenues amounting to 50,000 scudi. Giacomo
    Buoncompagno's whole estate was estimated at 120,000 scudi; while the two Cardinal
    nephews of Gregory XIII. had each about 10,000 a year. At the same epoch Paolo
    Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, enjoyed an income of some 25,000, his estate
    being worth 60,000, but being heavily encumbered. These figures are taken from the
    Reports of the Venetian <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
    id="page157"></a>{157}</span> envoys. If we may trust them as accurate, it will
    appear by a comparison of them with the details furnished by Ranke, that Gregory's
    successors treated their relatives with greater generosity.<a name="FNanchor_76_76"
    id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Sixtus V.
    enriched the Cardinal Montalto with an ecclesiastical income of 100,000 scudi.
    Clement VIII. bestowed on two nephews&mdash;one Cardinal, the other
    layman&mdash;revenues of about 60,000 apiece in 1599. He is computed to have hoarded
    altogether for his family a round sum of 1,000,000 scudi. Paul V. was believed to
    have given to his Borghese relatives nearly 700,000 scudi in cash, 24,600 scudi in
    funds, and 268,000 in the worth of offices.<a name="FNanchor_77_77"
    id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The
    Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, nephew of Gregory XV., had a reputed income of 200,000
    scudi; and the Ludovisi family obtained 800,000 in <i>luoghi di monte</i> or funds.
    Three nephews of Urban VIII., <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
    id="page158"></a>{158}</span> the brothers Barberini, were said to have enjoyed joint
    revenues amounting to half a million scudi, and their total gains from the
    pontificate touched the enormous sum of 105,000,000. These are the families, sprung
    from obscurity or mediocre station, whose palaces and villas adorn Rome, and who now
    rank, though of such recent origin, with the aristocracy of Europe.</p>
    <p>Sixtus V. died in 1590. To follow the history of his successors would be
    superfluous for the purpose of this book. The change in the Church which began in the
    reign of Paul III. was completed in his pontificate. About half a century, embracing
    seven tenures of the Holy Chair, had sufficed to develop the new phase of the Papacy
    as an absolute sovereignty, representing the modern European principle of absolutism,
    both as the acknowledged Head of Catholic Christendom and also as a petty Italian
    power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>{159}</span></p>

    <p>In pursuing the plan of this book, which aims at showing how the spirit of the
    Catholic revival pene<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
    id="page160"></a>{160}</span> trated every sphere of intellectual activity in Italy,
    it will now be needful to consider the two agents, both of Spanish origin, on whose
    assistance the Church relied in her crusade against liberties of thought, speech, and
    action. These were the Inquisition and the Company of Jesus. The one worked by
    extirpation and forcible repression; the other by mental enfeeblement and moral
    corruption. The one used fire, torture, imprisonment, confiscation of goods, the
    proscription of learning, the destruction or emasculation of books. The other
    employed subtle means to fill the vacuum thus created with spurious erudition,
    sophistries, casuistical abominations and false doctrines profitable to the Papal
    absolutism. Opposed in temper and in method, the one fierce and rigid, the other
    saccharine and pliant, these two bad angels of Rome contributed in almost equal
    measure to the triumph of Catholicism.</p>
    <p>In the earlier ages of the Church, the definition of heresy had been committed to
    episcopal authority. But the cognizance of heretics and the determination of their
    punishment remained in the hands of secular magistrates. At the end of the twelfth
    century the wide diffusion of the Albigensian heterodoxy through Languedoc and
    Northern Italy alarmed the chiefs of Christendom, and furnished the Papacy with a
    good pretext for extending its prerogatives. Innocent III. in 1203 empowered two
    French Cistercians, Pierre de Castelnau and Raoul, to preach against the heretics of
    Provence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span> In the
    following year he ratified this commission by a Bull, which censured the negligence
    and coldness of the bishops, appointed the Abbot of Citeaux Papal delegate in matters
    of heresy, and gave him authority to judge and punish misbelievers. This was the
    first germ of the Holy Office as a separate Tribunal. In order to comprehend the
    facility with which the Pope established so anomalous an institution, we must bear in
    mind the intense horror which heresy inspired in the Middle Ages. Being a distinct
    encroachment of the Papacy upon the episcopal jurisdiction and prerogatives, the
    Inquisition met at first with some opposition from the bishops. The people for whose
    persecution it was designed, and at whose expense it carried on its work, broke into
    rebellion; the first years of its annals were rendered illustrious by the murder of
    one of its founders, Pierre de Castelnau. He was canonized, and became the first
    Saint of the Inquisition. Two other Peters obtained the like honor through their zeal
    for the Catholic faith: Peter of Verona, commonly called Peter Martyr, the Italian
    saint of the Dominican order; and Peter Arbues, the Spanish saint, who sealed with
    his blood the charter of the Holy Office in Aragon.</p>
    <p>In spite of opposition, the Papal institution took root and flourished. Philip
    Augustus responded to the appeals of Innocent; and a crusade began against the
    Albigenses, in which Simon de Montfort won his sinister celebrity. During those
    bloody <span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>{162}</span> wars the
    Inquisition developed itself as a force of formidable expansive energy. Material
    assistance to the cause was rendered by a Spanish monk of the Augustine order, who
    settled in Provence on his way back from Rome in 1206. Domenigo de Guzman, known to
    universal history as S. Dominic, organized a new militia for the service of the
    orthodox Church between the years 1215 and 1219. His order, called the Order of the
    Preachers, was originally designed to repress heresy and confirm the faith by
    diffusing Catholic doctrine and maintaining the creed in its purity. It consisted of
    three sections: the Preaching Friars; nuns living in conventual retreat; and laymen,
    entitled the Third Order of Penitence or the Militia of Christ, who in after years
    were merged with the congregation of S. Peter Martyr, and corresponded to the
    familiars of the Inquisition. Since the Dominicans were established in the heat and
    passion of a crusade against heresy, by a rigid Spaniard who employed his energies in
    persecuting misbelievers, they assumed at the outset a belligerent and inquisitorial
    attitude. Yet it is not strictly accurate to represent S. Dominic himself as the
    first Grand Inquisitor. The Papacy proceeded with caution in its design of forming a
    tribunal dependent on the Holy See and independent of the bishops. Papal Legates with
    plenipotentiary authority were sent to Languedoc, and decrees were issued against the
    heretics, in which the Inquisition was rather implied than <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span> directly named; nor can I find that S.
    Dominic, though he continued to be the soul of the new institution until his death in
    1221, obtained the title of Inquisitor.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding this vagueness, the Holy Office may be said to have been founded
    by S. Dominic; and it soon became apparent that the order he had formed, was destined
    to monopolize its functions. The Emperor Frederick II. on his coronation, in 1221,
    declared his willingness to support a separate Apostolical tribunal for the
    suppression of heresy. He sanctioned the penalty of death by fire for obstinate
    heretics, and perpetual imprisonment for penitents&mdash;forms of punishment which
    became stereotyped in the proceedings of the Holy Office.<a name="FNanchor_78_78"
    id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The
    tribunal, now recognized as a Dominican institution, derived its authority from the
    Pope. The bishops were suffered to sit with the Inquisitors, but only in such
    subordinate capacity as left to them a bare title of authority.<a
    name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79"
    class="fnanchor">[79]</a> The secular magistracy was represented by an assessor, who,
    being nominated by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"
    id="page164"></a>{164}</span> the Inquisitor, became his servile instrument. The
    expenses of the Court in prosecuting, punishing and imprisoning heretics, together
    with the maintenance of the Inquisitors and their guards, were thrown upon the
    communes which they visited. Such was the organization which the Popes, aided by S.
    Dominic, and availing themselves of the fanatical passions aroused in the
    Proven&ccedil;al wars, succeeded in creating for their own aggrandizement. It is
    strange to think that its ratification by the supreme secular power was obtained from
    an Emperor who died in contumacy, excommunicated and persecuted as an arch-heretic by
    the priests he had supported.</p>
    <p>This Apostolical Inquisition was at once introduced into Lombardy, Romagna and the
    Marches of Treviso. The extreme rigor of its proceedings, the extortions of monks,
    and the violent resistance offered by the communes, led to some relaxation of its
    original constitution. More authority had to be conceded to the bishops; and the
    right of the Inquisitors to levy taxes on the people was modified. Yet it retained
    its true form of a Papal organ, superseding the episcopal prerogatives, and
    overriding the secular magistrates, who were bound to execute its biddings. As such
    it was admitted into Tuscany, and established in Aragon. Venice received it in 1289,
    with certain reservations that placed its proceedings under the control of Doge and
    Council. In Languedoc, the country of its birth, it remained rooted at Toulouse and
    Carcassonne; but the In<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"
    id="page165"></a>{165}</span> quisition did not extend its authority over central and
    northern France.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> In Paris its functions were
    performed by the Sorbonne. Nor did it obtain a footing in England, although the
    statute 'De Haeretico Comburendo,' passed in 1401 at the instance of the higher
    clergy, sanctioned the principles on which it existed.</p>
    <p>The wide and ready acceptance of so terrible an engine of oppression enables us to
    estimate the profound horror which heresy inspired in the Middle Ages.<a
    name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81"
    class="fnanchor">[81]</a> On the whole, the Inquisition performed the work for which
    it had been instituted. Those spreading sects, known as Waldenses, Albigenses,
    Cathari and Paterines, whom it was commissioned to extirpate, died away into
    obscurity during the fourteenth century; and through the period of the Renaissance
    the Inquisition had little scope for the display of energy in Italy. Though dormant,
    it was by no means extinct, however; and the spirit which created it, needed only
    external cause and circumstance to bring it once more into powerful operation.
    Meanwhile the Popes throughout the Renaissance used the imputation of heresy, which
    never lost its blighting stigma, in the prosecution of their secular <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>{166}</span> ambition. As Sarpi
    has pointed out, there were few of the Italian princes with whom they came into
    political collision, who were not made the subject of such accusation.</p>
    <p>The revival of the Holy Office on a new and far more murderous basis, took place
    in 1484. We have seen that hitherto there had been two types of inquisition into
    heresy. The first, which remained in force up to the year 1203, may be called the
    episcopal. The second was the Apostolical or Dominican: it transferred this
    jurisdiction from the bishops to the Papacy, who employed the order of S. Dominic for
    the special service of the tribunal instituted by the Imperial decrees of Frederick
    II. The third deserves no other name than Spanish, though, after it had taken shape
    in Spain, it was transferred to Portugal, applied in all the Spanish and Portuguese
    colonies, and communicated with some modifications to Italy and the Netherlands.<a
    name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"
    class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Both the second and third types of Inquisition into heresy
    were Spanish inventions, patented by the Roman Pontiffs and monopolized by the
    Dominican order. But the third and final form of the Holy Office <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> in Spain
    distinguished itself by emancipation from Papal and Royal control, and by a specific
    organization which rendered it the most formidable of irresponsible engines in the
    annals of religious institutions.</p>
    <p>The crimes of which the second or Dominican Inquisition had taken cognizance were
    designated under the generic name of heresy. Heretics were either patent by
    profession of some heterodox cult or doctrine; or they were suspected. The suspected
    included witches, sorcerers, and blasphemers who invoked the devil's aid; Catholics
    abstaining from confession and absolution; harborers of avowed heretics; legal
    defenders of the cause of heretics; priests who gave Christian burial to heretics;
    magistrates who showed lukewarmness in pursuit of heretics; the corpses of dead
    heretics, and books that might be taxed with heretical opinions. All ranks in the
    social hierarchy, except the Pope, his Legates and Nuncios, and the bishops, were
    amenable to this Inquisition. The Inquisitors could only be arraigned and judged by
    their peers. In order to bring the machinery of imprisonment, torture and final
    sentence into effect, it was needful that the credentials of the Inquisitor should be
    approved by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span> the
    sovereign, and that his procedure should be recognized by the bishop. These
    limitations of the Inquisitorial authority safeguarded the crown and the episcopacy
    in a legal sense. But since both crown and episcopacy concurred in the object for
    which the Papacy had established the tribunal, the Inquisitor was practically
    unimpeded in his functions. Furnished with royal or princely letters patent, he
    traveled from town to town, attended by his guards and notaries, defraying current
    expenses at the cost of provinces and towns through which he passed. Where he pitched
    his camp, he summoned the local magistrates, swore them to obedience, and obtained
    assurance of their willingness to execute such sentences as he might pronounce. Spies
    and informers gathered round him, pledged to secrecy and guaranteed by promises of
    State-protection. The Court opened; witnesses were examined; the accused were
    acquitted or condemned. Then sentence was pronounced, to which the bishop or his
    delegate, often an Inquisitor, gave a formal sanction. Finally, the heretic was
    handed over to the secular arm for the execution of justice. The extraordinary
    expenses of the tribunal were defrayed by confiscation of goods, a certain portion
    being paid to the district in which the crime had occurred, the rest being reserved
    for the maintenance of the Holy Office.</p>
    <p>Such, roughly speaking, was the method of the Inquisition before 1484; and it did
    not materially differ in Italy and Spain. Castile had hitherto <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>{169}</span> been free from the
    pest. But the conditions of that kingdom offered a good occasion for its introduction
    at the date which I have named. During the Middle Ages the Jews of Castile acquired
    vast wealth and influence. Few families but felt the burden of their bonds and
    mortgages. Religious fanaticism, social jealousy, and pecuniary distress exasperated
    the Christian population; and as early as the year 1391, more than 5000 Jews were
    massacred in one popular uprising. The Jews, in fear, adopted Christianity. It is
    said that in the fifteenth century the population counted some million of
    converts&mdash;called New Christians, or, in contempt, Marranos: a word which may
    probably be derived from the Hebrew Maranatha. These converted Jews, by their ability
    and wealth, crept into high offices of state, obtained titles of aristocracy, and
    founded noble houses. Their daughters were married with large dowers into the best
    Spanish families; and their younger sons aspired to the honors of the Church.
    Castilian society was being penetrated with Jews, many of whom had undoubtedly
    conformed to Christianity in externals only. Meanwhile a large section of the Hebrew
    race remained faithful to their old traditions; and a mixed posterity grew up, which
    hardly knew whether it was Christian or Jewish, and had opportunity for joining
    either party.</p>
    <p>A fertile field was now opened for Inquisitorial energy. The orthodox Dominican
    saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span> Christ's
    flock contaminated. Not without reason did earnest Catholics dread that the Church in
    Castile would suffer from this blending of the Jewish with the Spanish breed. But
    they had a fiery Catholic enthusiasm to rely upon in the main body of the nation. And
    in the crown they knew that there were passions of fear and cupidity, which might be
    used with overmastering effect. It sufficed to point out to Ferdinand that a
    persecution of the New Christians would flood his coffers with gold extorted from
    suspected misbelievers. No merely fabled El Dorado lay in the broad lands and costly
    merchandise of these imperfect converts to the faith. It sufficed to insist upon the
    peril to the State if an element so ill-assimilated to the nation were allowed to
    increase unchecked. At the same time, the Papacy was nothing loth to help them in
    their undertaking. Sixtus V., one of the worst of Pontiffs, sat then on S. Peter's
    chair. He readily discerned that a considerable portion of the booty might be
    indirectly drawn into his exchequer; and he knew that any establishment of the
    Inquisition on an energetic basis would strengthen the Papacy in its combat with
    national and episcopal prerogatives. The Dominicans on their side can scarcely be
    credited with a pure zeal for the faith. They had personal interests to serve by
    spiritual aggrandizement, by the elevation of their order, and by the exercise of an
    illimitable domination.</p>
    <p>It was a Sicilian Inquisitor, Philip Barberis, who <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page171" id="page171"></a>{171}</span> suggested to Ferdinand the Catholic the
    advantage he might secure by extending the Holy Office to Castile. Ferdinand avowed
    his willingness; and Sixtus IV. gave the project his approval in 1478. But it met
    with opposition from the gentler-natured Isabella. She refused at first to sanction
    the introduction of so sinister an engine into her hereditary dominions. The clergy
    now contrived to raise a popular agitation against the Jews, reviving old calumnies
    of impossible crimes, and accusing them of being treasonable subjects. Then Isabella
    yielded; and in 1481 the Holy Office was founded at Seville. It began its work by
    publishing a comprehensive edict against all New Christians suspected of Judaizing,
    which offense was so constructed as to cover the most innocent observance of national
    customs. Resting from labor on Saturday; performing ablutions at stated times;
    refusing to eat pork or puddings made of blood; and abstaining from wine, sufficed to
    color accusations of heresy. Men who had joined the Catholic communion after the
    habits of a lifetime had been formed, thus found themselves exposed to peril of death
    by the retention of mere sanitary rules.<a name="FNanchor_83_83"
    id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
    <p>Upon the publication of this edict, there was an <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page172" id="page172"></a>{172}</span> exodus of Jews by thousands into the
    fiefs of independent vassals of the crown&mdash;the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the
    Marquis of Cadiz, and the Count of Arcos. All emigrants were <i>ipso facto</i>
    declared heretics by the Holy Office. During the first year after its foundation,
    Seville beheld 298 persons burned alive, and 79 condemned to perpetual imprisonment.
    A large square stage of stone, called the Quemadero, was erected for the execution of
    those multitudes who were destined to suffer death by hanging or by flame. In the
    same year, 2000 were burned and 17,000 condemned to public penitence, while even a
    larger number were burned in effigy, in other parts of the kingdom.</p>
    <p>While estimating the importance of these punishments we must remember that they
    implied confiscation of property. Thus whole families were orphaned and consigned to
    penury. Penitence in public carried with it social infamy, loss of civil rights and
    honors, intolerable conditions of ecclesiastical surveillance, and heavy pecuniary
    fines. Penitents who had been reconciled, returned to society in a far more degraded
    condition than convicts released on ticket of leave. The stigma attached in
    perpetuity to the posterity of the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
    id="page173"></a>{173}</span> demned, whose names were conspicuously emblazoned upon
    church-walls as foemen to Christ and to the State.</p>
    <p>It is not strange that the New Christians, wealthy as they were and allied with
    some of the best blood in Spain, should have sought to avert the storm descending on
    them by appeals to Rome. In person or by procurators, they carried their complaints
    to the Papal Curia, imploring the relief of private reconciliation with the Church,
    special exemption from the jurisdiction of the Holy Office, rehabilitation after the
    loss of civil rights and honors, dispensation from humiliating penances, and
    avvocation of causes tried by the Inquisition, to less prejudiced tribunals. The
    object of these petitions was to avoid perpetual infamy, to recover social status,
    and to obtain an impartial hearing in doubtful cases. The Papal Curia had anticipated
    the profits to be derived from such appeals. Sixtus IV. was liberal in briefs of
    indulgence, absolution and exemption, to all comers who paid largely. But when his
    suitors returned to Spain, they found their dearly-purchased parchments of no more
    value than waste paper. The Holy Office laughed Papal Bulls of Privilege to scorn,
    and the Pope was too indifferent to exert such authority as he might have
    possessed.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, the Inquisition rapidly took shape. In 1483 Thomas of Torquemada was
    nominated Inquisitor General for Castile and Aragon. Under <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page174" id="page174"></a>{174}</span> his rule a Supreme Council was
    established, over which he presided for life. The crown sent three assessors to this
    board; and the Inquisitors were strengthened in their functions by a council of
    jurists. Seville, Cordova, Jaen, Toledo, became the four subordinate centers of the
    Holy Office, each with its own tribunal and its own right of performing <i>autos da
    f&eacute;</i>. Commission was sent out to all Dominicans, enjoining on them the
    prosecution of their task in every diocese.</p>
    <p>In 1484 a General Council was held, and the constitution of the inquisition was
    established by articles. In these articles four main points seem to have been held in
    view. The first related to the system of confiscation, fines, civil disabilities,
    losses of office, property, honors, rights, inheritances, which formed a part of the
    penitentiary procedure, and by which the crown and Holy Office made pecuniary gains.
    The second secured secrecy in the action of the tribunal, whereby a door was opened
    to delation, and accused persons were rendered incapable of rational defense. The
    third elaborated the judicial method, so as to leave no loophole of escape even for
    those who showed a wish to be converted, empowering the use of torture, precluding
    the accused from choosing their own counsel, and excluding the bishops from active
    participation in the sentence. The fourth multiplied the charges under which
    suspected heretics, even after their death might be treated as impenitent or <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> relapsed, so as to
    increase the number of victims and augment the booty.</p>
    <p>The two most formidable features of the Inquisition as thus constituted, were the
    exclusion of the bishops from its tribunal and the secrecy of its procedure. The
    accused was delivered over to a court that had no mercy, no common human sympathies,
    no administrative interest in the population. He knew nothing of his accusers; and
    when he died or disappeared from view no record of his case survived him.</p>
    <p>The Inquisition rested on the double basis of ecclesiastical fanaticism and
    protected delation. The court was <i>prim&acirc; facie</i> hostile to the accused;
    and the accused could never hope to confront the detectives upon whose testimony he
    was arraigned before it. Lives and reputations lay thus at the mercy of professional
    informers, private enemies, malicious calumniators. The denunciation was sometimes
    anonymous, sometimes signed, with names of two corroborative witnesses. These
    witnesses were examined, under a strict seal of secrecy, by the Inquisitors, who drew
    up a form of accusation, which they submitted to theologians called Qualificators.
    The qualificators were not informed of the names of the accused, the delator, or the
    witnesses. It was their business to qualify the case of heresy as light, grave, or
    violent. Having placed it in one of these categories, they returned it to the
    Inquisitors, who now arrested the accused and flung him into the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>{176}</span> secret prisons of the
    Holy Office. After some lapse of time he was summoned for a preliminary examination.
    Having first been cautioned to tell the truth, he had to recite the Paternoster,
    Credo, Ten Commandments, and a kind of catechism. His pedigree was also investigated,
    in the expectation that some traces of Jewish or Moorish descent might serve to
    incriminate him. If he failed in repeating the Christian shibboleths, or if he was
    discovered to have infidel ancestry, there existed already a good case to proceed
    upon. Finally, he was questioned upon the several heads of accusation condensed from
    the first delation and the deposition of the witnesses. If needful at this point, he
    was put to the torture, again and yet again.<a name="FNanchor_84_84"
    id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He never
    heard the names of his accusers, nor was he furnished with a full bill of the charges
    against him in writing. At this stage he was usually remanded, and the judicial
    proceedings were deliberately lengthened out with a view of crushing his spirit and
    bringing him to abject submission. For his defence he might select one advocate, but
    only from a list furnished by his judges; and this advocate in no case saw the
    original documents of the impeachment. It rarely happened, upon this one-sided method
    of trial, that an accused person was acquitted altogether. If he escaped burning or
    perpetual incarceration, he was almost <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"
    id="page177"></a>{177}</span> certainly exposed to the public ceremony of penitence,
    with its attendant infamy, fines, civil disabilities, and future discipline. Sentence
    was not passed upon condemned persons until they appeared, dressed up in a San
    Benito, at the place of punishment. This costume was a sort of sack, travestying a
    monk's frock, made of coarse yellow stuff, and worked over with crosses, flames, and
    devils, in glaring red. It differed in details according to the destination of the
    victim: for some ornaments symbolized eternal hell, and others the milder fires of
    purgatory. If sufficiently versed in the infernal heraldry of the Holy Office, a
    condemned man might read his doom before he reached the platform of the <i>auto</i>.
    There he heard whether he was sentenced to relaxation&mdash;in other words, to
    burning at the hands of the hangman&mdash;or to reconciliation by means of penitence.
    At the last moment, he might by confession <i>in extremis</i> obtain the commutation
    of a death sentence into life-imprisonment, or receive the favor of being strangled
    before he was burned. A relapsed heretic, however&mdash;that is, one who after being
    reconciled had once again apostatized, was never exempted from the penalty of
    burning. To make these holocausts of human beings more ghastly, the pageant was
    enhanced by processions of exhumed corpses and heretics in effigy. Artificial dolls
    and decomposed bodies, with grinning lips and mouldy foreheads, were hauled to the
    huge bonfire, side by side with living men, women, and children. All of them <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>{178}</span>
    alike&mdash;<i>fantoccini</i>, skeletons, and quick folk&mdash;were enveloped in the
    same grotesquely ghastly San Benito, with the same hideous yellow miters on their
    pasteboard, worm-eaten, or palpitating foreheads. The procession presented an
    ingeniously picturesque discord of ugly shapes, an artistically loathsome dissonance
    of red and yellow hues, as it defiled, to the infernal music of growled psalms and
    screams and moanings, beneath the torrid blaze of Spanish sunlight.</p>
    <p>Spaniards&mdash;such is the barbarism of the Latinized Iberian
    nature&mdash;delighted in these shows, as they did and do in bull-fights. Butcheries
    of heretics formed the choicest spectacles at royal christenings and bridals.</p>
    <p>At Seville the Quemadero was adorned with four colossal statues of prophets, to
    which some of the condemned were bound, so that they might burn to death in the
    flames arising from the human sacrifice between them.</p>
    <p>In the autumn of 1484 the Inquisition was introduced into Aragon; and Saragossa
    became its headquarters in that State. Though the Aragonese were accustomed to the
    institution in its earlier and milder form, they regarded the new Holy Office with
    just horror. The Marranos counted at that epoch the Home Secretary, the Grand
    Treasurer, a Proto-notary, and a Vice-Chancellor of the realm among their members;
    and they were allied by marriage with the purest aristocracy. It is not, therefore,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>{179}</span> marvelous that
    a conspiracy was formed to assassinate the Chief Inquisitor, Peter Arbues. In spite
    of a coat-of-mail and an iron skullcap worn beneath his monk's dress, Arbues was
    murdered one evening while at prayer in church. But the revolt, notwithstanding this
    murder, flashed, like an ill-loaded pistol, in the pan. Jealousies between the old
    and new Christians prevented any common action; and the Inquisition took a bloody
    vengeance upon all concerned. It even laid its hand on Don James of Navarre, the
    Infant of Tudela.</p>
    <p>The Spanish Inquisition was now firmly grounded. Directed by Torquemada, it began
    to encroach upon the crown, to insult the episcopacy, to defy the Papacy, to grind
    the Commons, and to outrage by its insolence the aristocracy. Ferdinand's avarice had
    overreached itself by creating an ecclesiastical power dangerous to the best
    interests of the realm, but which fascinated a fanatically-pious people, and the yoke
    of which could not be thrown off. The Holy Office grew every year in pride,
    pretensions, and exactions. It arrogated to its tribunal crimes of usury, bigamy,
    blasphemous swearing, and unnatural vice, which appertained by right to the secular
    courts. It depopulated Spain by the extermination and banishment of at least three
    million industrious subjects during the first 139 years of its existence. It attacked
    princes of the blood,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> arch<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> bishops, fathers of the Tridentine
    Council. It filled every city in the kingdom, the convents of the religious, and the
    palaces of the nobility, with spies. The Familiars, or lay brethren devoted to its
    service, lived at charges of the communes, and debauched society by crimes of rapine,
    lust, and violence.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Ignorant and bloodthirsty monks
    composed its provincial tribunals, who, like the horrible Lucero el Tenebroso at
    Cordova, paralyzed whole provinces with a veritable reign of terror.<a
    name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"
    class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Hated and worshiped, its officers swept through the realm
    in the guise of powerful <i>condottieri</i>. The Grand Inquisitor maintained a
    bodyguard of fifty mounted Familiars and two hundred infantry; his subordinates were
    allowed ten horsemen and fifty archers apiece. Where these black guards appeared,
    city gates were opened; magistrates swore fealty to masters of more puissance than
    the king; the resources of flourishing districts were placed at their disposal. Their
    arbitrary acts remained unquestioned, their mysterious sentences irreversible.
    Shrouded in secrecy, amenable to no jurisdiction but their own, they reveled in the
    license of irresponsible dominion. Spain gradually fell beneath the charm of their
    dark fascination. A brave though cruel nation drank delirium from the poison-cup of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span> these vile
    medicine-men, whose Moloch-worship would have disgusted cannibals.</p>
    <p>Torquemada was the genius of evil who created and presided over this foul
    instrument of human crime and folly. During his eighteen years of administration,
    reckoning from 1480 to 1498, he sacrificed, according to Llorente's calculation,
    above 114,000 victims, of whom 10,220 were burned alive, 6,860 burned in effigy, and
    97,000 condemned to perpetual imprisonment or public penitence.<a
    name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
    class="fnanchor">[88]</a> He, too, it was who in 1492 compelled Ferdinand to drive
    the Jews from his dominions. They offered 30,000 ducats for the war against Granada,
    and promised to abide in Spain under heavy social disabilities, if only they might be
    spared this act of national extermination. Then Torquemada appeared before the king,
    and, raising his crucifix on high, cried: 'Judas sold Christ for thirty pieces of
    silver. Look ye to it, if ye do the like!' The edict of expulsion was issued on the
    last of March. Before the last of July all Jews were sentenced to depart, carrying no
    gold or silver with them. They disposed of their lands, houses, and goods for next to
    nothing, and went forth to die by thousands on the shores of Africa and Italy. Twelve
    who were found concealed at Malaga in August were condemned to be pricked to death by
    pointed reeds.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
    <p>The exodus of the Jews was followed in 1502 <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span> by a similar exodus of Moors from
    Castile, and in 1524 by an exodus of Mauresques from Aragon. To compute the loss of
    wealth and population inflicted upon Spain by these mad edicts, would be impossible.
    We may wonder whether the followers of Cortez, when they trod the teocallis of Mexico
    and gazed with loathing on the gory elf-locks of the Aztec priests, were not reminded
    of the Torquemada they had left at home. His cruelty became so intolerable that even
    Alexander VI. was moved to horror. In 1494 the Borgia appointed four assessors, with
    equal powers, to restrain the blood-thirst of the fanatic.</p>
    <p>After Torquemada, Diego Deza reigned as second Inquisitor General from 1498 to
    1507. In these years, according to the same calculation, 2,592 were burned alive, 896
    burned in effigy, 34,952 condemned to prison or public penitence.<a
    name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"
    class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Cardinal Ximenez de Cisneros followed between 1507 and
    1517. The victims of this decade were 3,564 burned alive, 1,232 burned in effigy,
    48,059 condemned to prison or public penitence.<a name="FNanchor_91_91"
    id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Adrian,
    Bishop of Tortosa, tutor to Charles V., and afterwards Pope, was Inquisitor General
    between 1516 and 1525. Castile, Aragon, and Catalonia, at this epoch, simultaneously
    demanded a reform of the Holy Office from their youthful sovereign. But Charles
    refused, and the tale of Adrian's administration was 1,620 burned alive, 560 burned
    in effigy, 21,845 con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"

    class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The total, during forty-three years, between 1481 and 1525,
    amounted to 234,526, including all descriptions of condemned heretics.<a
    name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93"
    class="fnanchor">[93]</a> These figures are of necessity vague, for the Holy Office
    left but meager records of its proceedings. The vast numbers of cases brought before
    the Inquisitors rendered their method of procedure almost as summary as that of
    Fouquier Thinville, while policy induced them to bury the memory of their victims in
    oblivion.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"

    <p>Sometimes, while reading the history of the Holy Office in Spain, we are tempted
    to imagine that the whole is but a grim unwholesome nightmare, or the fable of
    malignant calumny. That such is not the case, however, is proved by a jubilant
    inscription on the palace of the Holy Office at Seville, which records the triumphs
    of Torquemada. Of late <span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"
    id="page184"></a>{184}</span> years, too, the earth herself has disgorged some
    secrets of the Inquisition. 'A most curious discovery,' writes Lord Malmesbury in his
    Memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
    class="fnanchor">[95]</a> 'has been made at Madrid. Just at the time when the
    question of religious liberty was being discussed in the Cortes, Serrano had ordered
    a piece of ground to be leveled, in order to build on it; and the workmen came upon
    large quantities of human bones, skulls, lumps of blackening flesh, pieces of chains,
    and braids of hair. It was then recollected that the <i>autos da f&eacute;</i> used
    to take place at that spot in former days. Crowds of people rushed to the place, and
    the investigation was continued. They found layer upon layer of human remains,
    showing that hundreds had been inhumanly sacrificed. The excitement and indignation
    this produced among the people was tremendous, and the party for religious freedom
    taking advantage of it, a Bill on the subject was passed by an enormous majority.'
    Let modern Spain remember that a similar Aceldama lies hidden in the precincts of
    each of her chief towns!</p>
    <p>I have enlarged upon the details of the Spanish Inquisition for two reasons. In
    the first place it strikingly illustrates the character of the people who now had the
    upper hand in Italy. In the second place, its success induced Paul III., acting upon
    the advice of Giov. Paolo Caraffa, to remodel the Roman office on a similar type in
    1542. It may at once be said that the real Spanish Inquisition was never <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>{185}</span> introduced into
    Italy.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
    class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Such an institution, claiming independent jurisdiction and
    flaunting its cruelties in the light of day, would not have suited the Papal policy.
    As temporal and spiritual autocrats, the Popes could not permit a tribunal of which
    they were not the supreme authority. It was their interest to consult their pecuniary
    advantage rather than to indulge insane fanaticism; to repress liberty of thought by
    cautious surveillance rather than by public terrorism and open acts of cruelty. The
    Italian temperament was, moreover, more humane than the Spanish; nor had the refining
    culture of the Renaissance left no traces in the nation. Furthermore, the necessity
    for so Draconian an institution was not felt. Catholicism in Italy had not to contend
    with Jews and Moors, Marranos and Moriscoes. It was, indeed, alarmed by the spread of
    Lutheran opinions. Caraffa complained to Paul III. that 'the whole of Italy is
    infected with the Lutheran heresy, which has been embraced not only by statesmen, but
    also by many ecclesiastics.'<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Pius V. was so panic-stricken by the
    prevalence of heresy in Faenza that he seriously meditated destroying the town and
    dispersing its inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Yet, after a few years of active
    persecution, this peril proved to be unreal. The Reformation had not taken root so
    deep and wide in Italy that it could not be eradicated.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page186" id="page186"></a>{186}</span> When, therefore, the Spanish viceroys
    sought to establish their national Inquisition in Naples and Milan, the rebellious
    people received protection and support from the Papacy; and the Holy Office, as
    remodeled in Rome, became a far less awful engine of oppression than that of
    Seville.</p>
    <p>It was sufficiently severe, however. 'At Rome,' writes a resident in 1568, 'some
    are daily burned, hanged, or beheaded; the prisons and places of confinement are
    filled, and they are obliged to build new ones.'<a name="FNanchor_99_99"
    id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> This
    general statement may be checked by extracts from the despatches of Venetian
    ambassadors in Rome, which, though they are not continuous, and cannot be supposed to
    give an exhaustive list of the victims of the Inquisition, enable us to judge with
    some degree of accuracy what the frequency of executions may have been.<a
    name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"
    class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>
    <p>On September 27, 1567, a session of the Holy Office was held at S. Maria sopra
    Minerva. Seventeen heretics were condemned. Fifteen of these were sentenced to
    perpetual imprisonment, the galleys for life, fines, or temporary imprisonment,
    according to the nature of their offenses. Two were reserved for capital
    punishment&mdash;namely, Carnesecchi and a friar from Cividale di Belluno. They were
    beheaded and burned upon the bridge of S. Angelo on October 4. On May 28, 1569, there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>{187}</span> was an Act of
    the Inquisition at the Minerva, twenty Cardinals attending. Four impenitent heretics
    were condemned to the stake. Ten penitents were sentenced to various punishments of
    less severity. On August 2, 1578, occurred a singular scandal touching some Spaniards
    and Portuguese of evil manners, all of whom were burned with the exception of those
    who contrived to escape in time. On August 5, 1581, an English Protestant was burned
    for grossly insulting the Host. On February 20, 1582, after an Act of the Inquisition
    in due form, seventeen heretics were sentenced, three to death, and the rest to
    imprisonment, etc. We must bear in mind that Mutinelli, who published the extracts
    from the Venetian dispatches which contain these details, does not profess to aim at
    completeness. Gaps of several years occur between the documents of one envoy and
    those of his successor. Nor does it appear that the writers themselves took notice of
    more than solemn and ceremonial proceedings, in which the Acts of the Inquisition
    were published with Pontifical and Curial pomp.<a name="FNanchor_101_101"
    id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
    Still, when these considerations have been weighed, it will appear that the victims
    of the Inquisition, in Rome, could be counted, not by hundreds, but by units. After
    illustrious examples, like those of Aonio Paleario, Pietro Carnesecchi, Giordano
    Bruno, who were burned for Protestant or<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188"
    id="page188"></a>{188}</span> Atheistical opinions, the names of distinguished
    sufferers are few. Wary heretics, a Celio Secundo Curio, a Galeazzo Caracciolo, a
    Bernardino Ochino, a Pietro Martire Vermigli, a Pietro Paolo Vergerio, a Lelio
    Socino, escaped betimes to Switzerland, and carried on their warfare with the Church
    by means of writings.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Others, tainted with heresy, like
    Marco Antonio Flaminio, managed to satisfy the Inquisition by timely concessions. The
    Protestant Churches, which had sprung up in Venice, Lucca, Modena, Ferrara, Faenza,
    Vicenza, Bologna, Naples, and Siena, were easily dispersed.<a name="FNanchor_103_103"
    id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
    Their pastors fled or submitted. The flocks conformed to Catholic orthodoxy. Only in
    a few cases was extreme rigor displayed. A memorable massacre took place in the year
    1561 in Calabria within the province of Cosenza.<a name="FNanchor_104_104"
    id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Here
    at the end of the fourteenth century a colony of Waldensians had settled in some
    villages upon the coast. They preserved their peculiar beliefs and ritual, and after
    three centuries numbered about 4000 souls. Nearly <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page189" id="page189"></a>{189}</span> the whole of these, it seems, were
    exterminated by sword, fire, famine, torture, noisome imprisonment, and hurling from
    the summits of high cliffs. A few of the survivors were sent to work upon the Spanish
    galleys. Some women and children were sold into slavery. At Locarno, on the Lago
    Maggiore, a Protestant community of nearly 300 persons was driven into exile in 1555;
    and at Venice, in 1560-7, a small sect, holding reformed opinions, suffered
    punishment of a peculiar kind. We read of five persons by name, who, after being
    condemned by the Holy Office, were taken at night from their dungeons to the Porto
    del Lido beyond the Due Castelli, and there set upon a plank between two gondolas.
    The gondolas rowed asunder; and one by one the martyrs fell and perished in the
    waters.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page190" id="page190"></a>{190}</span></p>
    <p>The position of the Holy Office in Venice was so far peculiar as to justify a
    digression upon its special constitution. Always jealous of ecclesiastical
    interference, the Republic insisted on the Inquisition being made dependent on the
    State. Three nobles of senatorial rank were chosen to act as Assessors of the Holy
    Office in the capital; and in the subject cities this function was assigned to the
    Rectors, or lieutenants of S. Mark. It was the duty of these lay members to see that
    justice was impartially dealt by the ecclesiastical tribunal, to defend the State
    against clerical encroachments, and to refer dubious cases to the Doge in Council.
    They were forbidden to swear oaths of allegiance or of secrecy to the Holy Office,
    and were bound to be present at all trials, even in the case of ecclesiastical
    offenders. No causes could be avvocated to Rome, and no crimes except heresy were
    held to lie within the jurisdiction of the court. The State reserved to it<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>{191}</span> self witchcraft,
    profane swearing, bigamy and usury; allowed no interference with Jews, infidels and
    Greeks; forbade the confiscation of goods in which the heirs of condemned persons had
    interest; and made separate stipulations with regard to the Index of Prohibited
    Books. It precluded the Inquisition from extending its authority in any way, direct
    or indirect, over trades, arts, guilds, magistrates, and communal officials.<a
    name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106"
    class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The tenor of this system was to repress ecclesiastical
    encroachments on the State prerogatives, and to secure equity in the proceedings of
    the Holy Office. Had practice answered to theory in the Venetian Inquisition, by far
    the worst abuses of the institution would have been avoided. But as a matter of fact,
    causes were not unfrequently transferred to Rome; confiscations were permitted; and
    the lists of the condemned include Mussulmans, witches, conjurors, men of scandalous
    life, etc., showing that the jurisdiction of the Holy Office extended beyond heresy
    in Venice.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>
    <p>The truth is that the Venetians, though they were willing to risk an open rupture
    with Rome, remained at heart sound Churchmen devoted to the principles of the
    Catholic Reaction. The Republic conceded the fact of Inquisitorial authority, while
    it reserved the letter of State-supervision. Venetian decadence was marked by this
    hypocrisy of pride; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
    id="page192"></a>{192}</span> and so long as appearances were saved, the Holy Office
    exercised its functions freely. The nobles who acted as assessors had no sympathy
    with religious toleration, being themselves under the influence of confessors and
    directors.</p>
    <p>How little the subjects of S. Mark at this epoch trusted the good faith of laws
    securing liberty of thought in Venice, may be gathered from what happened immediately
    after the publication of the Index Expurgatorius in 1596. From an official report
    upon the decline of the printing trade in Venice, it appears that within the space of
    a few months the number of presses fell from 125 to 40.<a name="FNanchor_108_108"
    id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
    Printers were afraid to undertake either old or new works, and the trade languished
    for lack of books to publish. Yet an edict had been issued announcing that by the
    terms of the Concordat with Clement VIII., the Venetian press would only be subject
    to State control and not to the Roman tribunals.<a name="FNanchor_109_109"
    id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The
    truth is that, in regard both to the Holy Office and to the Index, Venice was never
    strong enough to maintain the independence which she boasted. By cunning use of the
    confessional, and by unscrupulous control of opinion, the Church succeeded in doing
    there much the same as in any other Italian city. Successive Popes made, indeed, a
    show of respecting the liberties of the Republic. On material <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>{193}</span> points, touching
    revenue and State-administration, they felt it wise to concede even more than
    complimentary privileges; and when Paul V. encroached upon these privileges, the
    Venetians were ready to resist him. Yet the quarrels between the Vatican and San
    Marco were, after all, but family disputes. The Venetians at the close of the
    sixteenth century proved themselves no better friends to spiritual freedom than were
    the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. Their political jealousies, commercial anxieties, and
    feints of maintaining a power that was rapidly decaying, denoted no partiality for
    the opponents of Rome&mdash;unless, like Sarpi, these wore the livery of the State,
    and defended with the pen its secular prerogatives. Therefore, when the Signory
    published Clement VIII.'s Index, when copies of that Index were sown broadcast, while
    only an edition of sixty was granted to the Concordat, authors and publishers felt,
    and felt rightly, that their day had passed. The art of printing sank at once to less
    than a third of its productivity. The city where it had flourished so long, and where
    it had effected so much of enduring value for European culture, was gagged in
    scarcely a less degree than Rome. We have full right to insist upon these facts, and
    to draw from them a stringent corollary. If Venice allowed the trade in books, which
    had brought her so much profit and such honor in the past, to be paralyzed by
    Clement's Index, what must have happened in other Italian towns? The blow which
    maimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span> Venetian
    literature, was mortal elsewhere; and the finest works of genius in the first half of
    the seventeenth century had to find their publishers in Paris.<a
    name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110"
    class="fnanchor">[110]</a> But these reflections have led me to anticipate the proper
    development of the subject of this chapter.</p>
    <p>In Italy at large, the forces of the Inquisition were directed, not as in Spain
    against heretics in masses, but against the leaders of heretical opinion; and less
    against personalities than against ideas. Italy during the Renaissance had been the
    workshop of ideas for Europe. It was the business of the Counter-Reformation to check
    the industry of that <i>officina scientiarum</i>, to numb the nervous centers which
    had previously emitted thought of pregnant import for the modern world, and to
    prevent the reflux of ideas, elaborated by the northern races in fresh forms, upon
    the intelligence which had evolved them. To do so now was comparatively easy. It only
    needed to put the engine of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum into working order in
    concert with the Inquisition.</p>
    <p>Throughout the Middle Ages it had been customary to burn heretical writings. The
    bishops, the universities, and the Dominican Inquisitors exercised this privilege;
    and by their means, in the age of manuscripts, the life of a book was soon
    extinguished. Whole libraries were sometimes sacrificed <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span> at one fell swoop, as in the case of the
    6000 volumes destroyed at Salamanca in 1490 by Torquemada, on a charge of sorcery.<a
    name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111"
    class="fnanchor">[111]</a> After the invention of printing it became more difficult
    to carry on this warfare against literature, while the rapid diffusion of Protestant
    opinions through the press rendered the need for their extermination urgent. Sixtus
    IV. laid a basis for the Index by prohibiting the publication of any books which had
    not previously been licensed by ecclesiastical authority. Alexander VI. by a brief of
    15O1 confirmed this measure, and placed books under the censorship of the episcopacy
    and the Inquisition. Finally, the Lateran Council, in its tenth session, held under
    the auspices of Leo X., gave solemn ecumenical sanction to these regulations.</p>
    <p>The censorship having been thus established, the next step was to form a list of
    books prohibited by the Inquisitors appointed for that purpose. The Sorbonne in Paris
    drew one up for their own use, and even presented a petition to Francis I. that
    publication through the press should be forbidden altogether.<a
    name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"
    class="fnanchor">[112]</a> A royal edict to this effect was actually promulgated in
    1535. Charles V. commissioned the University of Louvain in 1539 to furnish a similar
    catalogue, proclaiming at the same time the penalty of death for all who read or
    owned the works of Luther in his realms.<a name="FNanchor_113_113"
    id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The
    University printed their catalogue with Papal approval in 1549.<span

    <p>These lists of the Sorbonne and Louvain formed the nucleus of the Apostolic Index,
    which, after the close of the Council of Trent, became binding upon Catholics. When
    the Inquisition had been established in Rome, Caraffa, who was then at its head,
    obtained the sanction of Paul III. for submitting all books, old or new, printed or
    in manuscript, to the supervision of the Holy Office. He also contrived to place
    booksellers, public and private libraries, colporteurs and officers of customs, under
    the same authority; so that from 1543 forward it was a penal offence to print, sell,
    own, convey or import any literature, of which the Inquisition had not first been
    informed, and for the diffusion or possession of which it had not given its
    permission. Giovanni della Casa, who was sent in 1546 to Venice with commission to
    prosecute P. Paolo Vergerio for heresy, drew up a list of about seventy prohibited
    volumes, which was printed in that city.<a name="FNanchor_114_114"
    id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
    Other lists appeared, at Florence in 1552, and at Milan in 1554. Philip II. at last,
    in 1558, issued a royal edict commanding the publication of one catalogue which
    should form the standard for such Indices throughout his States.<a
    name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115"
    class="fnanchor">[115]</a> These lists, revised, collated, and confirmed by Papal
    authority, were reprinted, in the form which ever afterwards obtained, at Rome, by
    command of Paul IV. in 1559.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
    id="page197"></a>{197}</span></p>
    <p>The Tridentine Council ratified the regulations of the Inquisition and the Index
    concerning prohibited books, and referred the execution of them in detail to the
    Papacy. A congregation was appointed at Rome, which, though technically independent
    of the Holy Office, worked in concert with it. This Congregation of the Index brought
    the Tridentine decrees into harmony with the practice that had been developed by
    Caraffa as Inquisitor and Pope. Their list was published in 1564 with the authority
    of Pius IV. Finally, in 1595 the decrees embodying the statutes of the Church upon
    this topic were issued in print, together with a largely augmented catalogue of
    interdicted books. This document will form the basis of what I have to say with
    regard to the Catholic crusade against literature.</p>
    <p>Not without reason did Aonio Paleario call this engine of the Index 'a dagger
    drawn from the scabbard to assassinate letters'&mdash;<i>sica districta in omnes
    scriptores</i>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> Not without reason did Sarpi
    describe it as 'the finest secret which has ever been discovered for applying
    religion to the purpose of making men idiotic.'<a name="FNanchor_117_117"
    id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a><span

    <p>Index Expurgatorius sixty-one printing firms by name, all of whose publications
    were without exception prohibited, adding a similar prohibition for the books edited
    by any printer who had published the writings of any heretic; so that in fine, as
    Sarpi says, 'there was not a book left to read.' Truly he might well exclaim in
    another passage that the Church was doing its best to extinguish sound learning
    altogether.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
    <p>In order to gain a clear conception of the warfare carried on by Rome against free
    literature, it will be well to consider first the rules for the Index of Prohibited
    Books, sketched out by the fathers delegated by the Tridentine Council, published by
    Pius IV., augmented by Sixtus V., and reduced to their final form by Clement VIII. in
    1595.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"
    class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Afterwards I shall proceed to explain the operation of the
    system, and to illustrate by details the injury inflicted upon learning and
    enlightenment.</p>
    <p>The preambles to this document recite the circumstances under which the necessity
    for digesting an Index or Catalogue of Prohibited Books arose. These were the
    diffusion of heretical opinions at the epoch of the Lutheran schism, and their
    propagation through the press. The Council of Trent decreed that a list of writings
    'heretical, or suspected of heretical pravity, or injurious to manners and
    piety,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>{199}</span> should
    be drawn up. This charge they committed to prelates chosen from all nations, who,
    when the catalogue had been completed, referred it for sanction and approval to the
    Pope. He nominated a congregation of eminent ecclesiastics, by whose care the
    catalogue was perfected, and rules were framed, defining the use that should be made
    of it in future. It issued officially, as I have already stated, in 1564, the fifth
    year of the pontificate of Pius IV., with warning to all universities and civil and
    ecclesiastical authorities that any person of what grade or condition soever, whether
    clerk or layman, who should read or possess one or more of the proscribed volumes,
    would be accounted <i>ipso jure</i> excommunicate, and liable to prosecution by the
    Inquisition on a charge of heresy.<a name="FNanchor_120_120"
    id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
    Booksellers, printers, merchants, and custom-house officials received admonition that
    the threat of excommunication and prosecution concerned them specially.</p>
    <p>The first rules deal with the acknowledged writings of Protestant heresiarchs.
    Those of Luther, Zwingli, and Calvin, whether in their original languages or
    translated, are condemned absolutely and without exception. Next follow regulations
    for securing the monopoly of the Vulgate, considered as the sole authorized version
    of the Holy Scriptures. Translations of portions of the Bible made by learned men in
    Latin may be used by scholars with permission of a bishop, provided it be understood
    that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span> they are
    never appealed to as the inspired text. Translations into any vernacular idiom are
    strictly excluded from public use and circulation, but may, under exceptional
    circumstances, be allowed to students who have received license from a bishop or
    Inquisitor at the recommendation of their parish priest or confessor. Compilations
    made by heretics, in the form of dictionaries, concordances, etc., are to be
    prohibited until they have been purged and revised by censors of the press. The same
    regulation extends to polemical and controversial works touching on matters of
    doctrine in dispute between Catholics and Protestants. Next follow regulations
    concerning books containing lascivious or obscene matter, which are to be rigidly
    suppressed. Exception is made in favor of the classics, on account of their style;
    with the proviso that they are on no account to be given to boys to read. Treatises
    dealing professedly with occult arts, magic, sorcery, predictions of future events,
    incantation of spirits, and so forth, are to be proscribed; due reservation being
    made in favor of scientific observations touching navigation, agriculture, and the
    healing art, in which prognostics may be useful to mankind. Having thus broadly
    defined the literature which has to be suppressed or subjected to supervision, rules
    are laid down for the exercise of censure. Books, whereof the general tendency is
    good, but which contain passages savoring of heresy, superstition or divination,
    shall be reserved for the consideration <span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"
    id="page201"></a>{201}</span> of Catholic theologians appointed by the Inquisition;
    and this shall hold good also of prefaces, summaries, or annotations. All writings
    printed in Rome must be submitted to the judgment of the Vicar of the Pope, the
    Master of the Sacred Palace, or a person nominated by the Pontiff. In other cities
    the bishop, or his delegate, and the Inquisitor of the district, shall be responsible
    for examining printed or manuscript works previous to publication; and without their
    license it shall be illegal to circulate them. Inquisitorial visits shall from time
    to time be made, under the authority of the bishop and the Holy Office, in bookshops
    or printing houses, for the removal and destruction of prohibited works. Colporteurs
    of books across the frontiers, heirs and executors who have become depositaries of
    books, collectors of private libraries, as well as editors and booksellers, shall be
    liable to the same jurisdiction, bound to declare their property by catalogue, and to
    show license for the use, transmission, sale, or possession of the same.</p>
    <p>With regard to the correction of books, it is provided that this duty shall fall
    conjointly on bishops and Inquisitors, who must appoint three men distinguished for
    learning and piety to examine the text and make the necessary changes in it. Upon the
    report of these censors, the bishops and Inquisitors shall give license of
    publication, provided they are satisfied that the work of emendation has been duly
    performed. The censor must submit <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
    id="page202"></a>{202}</span> not only the body of a book, to scrupulous analysis;
    but he must also investigate the notes, summaries, marginal remarks, indexes,
    prefaces, and dedicatory epistles, lest haply pestilent opinions lurk there in
    ambush. He must keep a sharp lookout for heretical propositions, and arguments
    savoring of heresy; insinuations against the established order of the sacraments,
    ceremonies, usages and ritual of the Roman Church; new turns of phrase insidiously
    employed by heretics, with dubious and ambiguous expressions that may mislead the
    unwary; plausible citations of Scripture, or passages of holy writ extracted from
    heretical translations; quotations from the authorized text, which have been adduced
    in an unorthodox sense; epithets in honor of heretics, and anything that may redound
    to the praise of such persons; opinions savoring of sorcery and superstition;
    theories that involve the subjection of the human will to fate, fortune, and
    fallacious portents, or that imply paganism; aspersions upon ecclesiastics and
    princes; impugnments of the liberties, immunities, and jurisdiction of the Church;
    political doctrines in favor of antique virtues, despotic government, and the
    so-called Reason of State, which are in opposition to the evangelical and Christian
    law; satires on ecclesiastical rites, religious orders, and the state, dignity, and
    persons of the clergy; ribaldries or stories offensive and prejudicial to the fame
    and estimation of one's neighbors, together with lubricities, lascivious re<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> marks, lewd pictures,
    and capital letters adorned with obscene images. All such peccant passages are to be
    expunged, obliterated, removed or radically altered, before the license for
    publication be accorded by the ordinary.</p>
    <p>No book shall be printed without the author's name in full, together with his
    nationality, upon the title-page. If there be sufficient reason for giving an
    anonymous work to the world, the censor's name shall stand for that of the author.
    Compilations of words, sentences, excerpts, etc., shall pass under the name of the
    compiler. Publishers and booksellers are to take care that the printed work agrees
    with the MS. copy as licensed, and to see that all rules with regard to the author's
    name and his authority to publish have been observed. They are, moreover, to take an
    oath before the Master of the Sacred Palace in Rome, or before the bishop and
    Inquisitor in other places, that they will scrupulously follow the regulations of the
    Index. The bishops and Inquisitors are held responsible for selecting as censors, men
    of approved piety and learning, whose good faith and integrity they shall guarantee,
    and who shall be such as will obey no promptings of private hatred or of favor, but
    will do all for the glory of God and the advantage of the faithful. The approbation
    of such censors, together with the license of the bishop and Inquisitor, shall be
    printed at the opening of every published book. Finally, if any work composed by a
    condemned author shall be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
    id="page204"></a>{204}</span> licensed after due purgation and castration, it shall
    bear his name upon the title-page, together with the note of condemnation, to the end
    that, though the book itself be accepted, the author be understood to be rejected.
    Thus, for example, the title shall run as follows: 'The Library, by Conrad Gesner, a
    writer condemned for his opinions, which work was formerly published and proscribed,
    but is now expurgated and licensed by superior authority.'</p>
    <p>The Holy Office was made virtually responsible for the censorship of books. But,
    as I have already stated, there existed a Congregation of prelates in Rome to whom
    the final verdict upon this matter Was reserved. If an author in some provincial town
    composed a volume, he was bound in the first instance to submit the MS. to the censor
    appointed by the bishop and Inquisitor of his district. This man took time to weigh
    the general matter of the work before him, to scrutinize its propositions, verify
    quotations, and deliberate upon its tendency. When the license of the ordinary had
    been obtained, it was referred to the Roman Congregation of the Index, who might
    withhold or grant their sanction. So complicated was the machinery, and so vast the
    pressure upon the officials who were held responsible for the expurgation of every
    book imprinted or reprinted in all the Catholic presses, that even writers of
    conspicuous orthodoxy had to suffer grievous delays. An archbishop writes to Cardinal
    Sirleto about a book which had been examined <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
    id="page205"></a>{205}</span> thrice, at Rome, at Venice and again at Rome, and had
    obtained the Pope's approval, and yet the license for reprinting it is never
    issued.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The censors were not paid; and in
    addition to being overworked and over-burdened with responsibility, they were rarely
    men of adequate learning. In a letter from Bartolommeo de Valverde, chaplain to
    Philip II., under date 1584, we read plain-spoken complaints against these
    subordinates.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> 'Unacquainted with literature,
    they discharge the function of condemning books they cannot understand. Without
    knowledge of Greek or Hebrew, and animated by a prejudiced hostility against authors,
    they take the easy course of proscribing what they feel incapable of judging. In this
    way the works of many sainted writers and the useful commentaries made by Jews have
    been suppressed.' A memorial to Sirleto, presented by Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti,
    points out the negligence of the Index-makers and their superficial discharge of
    onerous duties, praying that in future men of learning and honesty should be
    employed, and that they should receive payment for their labors.<a
    name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"
    class="fnanchor">[123]</a> These are the expostulations addressed by faithful
    Catholics, engaged in literary work demanded by the Vatican, to a Cardinal who was
    the soul and mover of the Congregation. They do not question the salutary nature of
    the Index, but only call attention to the incapacity and ignorance of its unpaid
    officials.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span></p>
    <p>Meanwhile, it was no easy matter to appoint responsible and learned scholars to
    the post. The inefficient censors proceeded with their work of destruction and
    suppression. A commentator on a Greek Father, or the Psalms, was corrected by an
    ignoramus who knew neither Greek nor Hebrew, anxious to discover petty collisions
    with the Vulgate, and eager to create annoyances for the author. Latino Latini, one
    of the students employed by the Vatican, refused his name to an edition of Cyprian
    which he had carefully prepared with far more than the average erudition, because it
    had been changed throughout by the substitution of bad readings for good, in defiance
    of MS. authority, with a view of preserving a literal agreement with the Vulgate.<a
    name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124"
    class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Sigonius, another of the Vatican students, was instructed
    to prepare certain text-books by Cardinal Paleotti. These were an Ecclesiastical
    History, a treatise on the Hebrew Commonwealth, and an edition of Sulpicius Severus.
    The MSS. were returned to him, accused of unsound doctrine, and scrawled over with
    such remarks as 'false,' 'absurd.'<a name="FNanchor_125_125"
    id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
    <p>In addition to the intolerable delays of the Censure, and the arrogant inadequacy
    of its officials, learned men suffered from the pettiest persecution at the hands of
    informers. The Inquisitors themselves were often spies and persons of base origin.
    'The Roman Court,' says Sarpi, 'being anxious that the office of the Inquisition
    should not suffer through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
    id="page207"></a>{207}</span> negligence in its ministers, has confided these affairs
    to individuals without occupation, and whose mean estate renders them proud of their
    official position.'<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> It was not to be expected that
    such people should discharge their duties with intelligence and scrupulous equity.
    Pius V., himself an incorruptible Inquisitor, had to condemn one of his lieutenants
    for corruption or extortion of money by menaces.<a name="FNanchor_127_127"
    id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
    There was still another source of peril and annoyance to which scholars were exposed.
    Their comrades, engaged in similar pursuits, not unfrequently wreaked private spite
    by denouncing them to the Congregation.<a name="FNanchor_128_128"
    id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Van
    Linden indicated heresies in Osorius, Giovius, Albertus Pighius. The Jesuit Francesco
    Torres accused Ma&euml;s, and threatened Latini. Sigonius obtained a license for his
    <i>History of Bologna</i>, but could not print it, owing to the delation of secret
    enemies. Baronius, when he had finished his Martyrology, found that a cabal had
    raised insuperable obstacles in the way of its publication. I have been careful to
    select only examples of notoriously Catholic authors, men who were in the pay and
    under the special protection of the Vatican. How it fared with less favored scholars,
    may be left to the imagination. We are not astonished to find a man like Latini
    writing thus from Rome to Ma&euml;s during the pontificate of Paul IV.<a
    name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"
    class="fnanchor">[129]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"
    id="page208"></a>{208}</span></p>
    <p>'Have you not heard of the peril which threatens the very existence of books? What
    are you dreaming of, when now that almost every published book is interdicted, you
    still think of making new ones? Here, as I imagine, there is no one who for many
    years to come will dare to write except on business or to distant friends. An Index
    has been issued of the works which none may possess under pain of excommunication;
    and the number of them is so great that very few indeed are left to us, especially of
    those which have been published in Germany. This shipwreck, this holocaust of books
    will stop the production of them in your country also, if I do not err, and will
    teach editors to be upon their guard. As you love me and yourself, sit and look at
    your bookcases without opening their doors, and beware lest the very cracks let
    emanations come to you from those forbidden fruits of learning.' This letter was
    written in 1559, when Paul proscribed sixty-one presses, and prohibited the perusal
    of any work that issued from them. He afterwards withdrew this interdict. But the
    Index did not stop its work of extirpation.</p>
    <p>Another embarrassment which afflicted men of learning, was the danger of
    possessing books by heretics and the difficulty of procuring them.<a
    name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130"
    class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Yet they could not carry on their Biblical studies
    with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>{209}</span> out
    reference to such authors as, for example, Erasmus or Reuchlin. The universities
    loudly demanded that books of sound erudition by heretics should at least be
    expurgated and republished. Yet the process of disfiguring their arguments, effacing
    the names of authors, expunging the praises of heretics, altering quotations and
    retouching them all over, involved so much labor that the demand was never satisfied.
    The strict search instituted at the frontiers stopped the importation of books,<a
    name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131"
    class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and carriers refused to transmit them. In their dread of
    the Inquisition, these folk found it safer to abstain from book traffic altogether.
    Public libraries were exposed to intermittent raids, nor were private collections
    safe from such inspection. The not uncommon occurrence of old books in which precious
    and interesting passages have been erased with printer's ink, or pasted over with
    slips of opaque paper, testifies to the frequency of these inquisitorial
    visitations.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Any casual acquaintance, on
    leaving a man's house, might denounce him as the possessor <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page210" id="page210"></a>{210}</span> of a proscribed volume; and everybody
    who owned a book-case was bound to furnish the Inquisitors with a copy of his
    catalogue. Book-stalls lay open to the malevolence of informers. We possess an
    insolent letter of Antonio Possevino to Cardinal Sirleto, telling him that he had
    noticed a forbidden book by Filiarchi on a binder's counter, and bidding him to do
    his duty by suppressing it.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> When this Cardinal's library was
    exposed for sale after his death, the curious observed that it contained 1872 MSS. in
    Greek and Latin, 530 volumes of printed Greek books, and 3939 volumes of Latin, among
    which 39 were on the Index. But charity suggested that the Cardinal had retained
    these last for censure.</p>
    <p>During the period of the Counter-Reformation it was the cherished object of the
    Popes to restore ecclesiastical and theological learning. They gathered men of
    erudition round them in the Vatican, and established a press for the purpose of
    printing the Fathers and diffusing Catholic literature. But they were met in the
    pursuance of this project by very serious difficulties. Their own policy tended to
    stifle knowledge and suppress criticism. The scholars whom they chose as champions of
    the faith worked with tied hands. Baronio knew no Greek; Latini knew hardly any;
    Bellarmino is thought to have known but little. And yet these were the apostles of
    Catholic enlightenment, the defenders of the infallible Church against students of
    the caliber <span class="pagenum"><a name="page211" id="page211"></a>{211}</span> of
    Erasmus, Casaubon, Sarpi! An insuperable obstacle to sacred studies of a permanently
    useful kind was the Tridentine decree which had declared the Vulgate inviolable. No
    codex of age or authority which displayed a reading at variance with the inspired
    Latin version might be cited. Sirleto, custodian of the Vatican Library, refused
    lections from its MSS. to learned men, on the ground that they might seem to impugn
    the Vulgate.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> For the same reason, the critical
    labors of all previous students, from Valla to Erasmus, on the text of the Bible were
    suppressed, and the best MSS. of the Fathers were ruthlessly garbled, in order to
    bring their quotations into accordance with Jerome's translation. Galesini takes
    credit to himself in a letter to Sirleto for having withheld a clearly right reading
    in his edition of the Psalms, because it explained a mistake in the Vulgate.<a
    name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"
    class="fnanchor">[135]</a> We have seen how Latini's Cyprian suffered from the
    censure; and there is a lamentable history of the Vatican edition of Ambrose, which
    was so mutilated that the Index had to protect it from confrontation with the
    original codices.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This dishonest dealing not only
    discouraged students and paralyzed the energy of critical investigation; but it also
    involved the closing of public libraries to scholars. The Vatican could not afford to
    let the light of science in upon its workshop of forgeries and sophistications.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>{212}</span></p>
    <p>A voice of reasonable remonstrance was sometimes raised by even the most
    incorruptible children of the Church. Thus Bellarmino writes to Cardinal Sirleto,
    suggesting a doubt whether it is obligatory to adhere to the letter of the Tridentine
    decree upon the Vulgate.<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Is it rational, he asks, to
    maintain that every sentence in the Latin text is impeccable? Must we reject those
    readings in the Hebrew and the Greek, which elucidate the meaning of the Scriptures,
    in cases where Jerome has followed a different and possibly a corrupt authority?
    Would it not be more sensible to regard the Vulgate as the sole authorized version
    for use in universities, pulpits, and divine service, while admitting that it is not
    an infallible rendering of the inspired original? He also touches, in a similar
    strain of scholar-like liberality, upon the Septuagint, pointing out that this
    version cannot have been the work of seventy men in unity, since the translator of
    Job seems to have been better acquainted with Greek than Hebrew, while the reverse is
    true of the translator of Solomon. Such remonstrances were not, however, destined to
    make themselves effectively heard. Instead of relaxing its severity after the
    pontificate of Pius IV., the Congregation of the Index grew, as we have seen, more
    rigid, until, in the rules digested by Clement VIII., it enforced the strictest
    letter of the law regarding the Vulgate, and ratified all the hypocrisies and
    subterfuges which that implied.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>{213}</span> Under the
    conditions which I have attempted to describe, it was impossible that Italy should
    hold her place among the nations which encouraged liberal studies. Rome had one
    object in view&mdash;to gag the revolutionary free voice of the Renaissance, to
    protect conservative principles, to establish her own supremacy, and to secure the
    triumph of the Counter-Reformation. In pursuance of this policy, she had to react
    against the learning and the culture of the classical revival; and her views were
    seconded not only by the overwhelming political force of Spain in the Peninsula, but
    also by the petty princes who felt that their existence was imperiled.</p>
    <p>Independence of judgment was rigorously proscribed in all academies and seats of
    erudition. New methods of education and new text-books were forbidden. Professors
    found themselves hampered in their choice of antique authors. Only those classics
    which were sanctioned by the Congregation of the Index could be used in
    lecture-rooms. On the one hand, the great republican advocates of independence had
    incurred suspicion. On the other hand, the poets were prohibited as redolent of
    paganism. To mingle philosophy with rhetoric was counted a crime. Thomas Aquinas had
    set up Pillars of Hercules beyond which the reason might not seek to travel. Roman
    law had to be treated from the orthodox scholastic standpoint. Woe to the audacious
    jurist who made the Pandects serve for disquisitions on the rights of men and
    nations! Scholars <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
    id="page214"></a>{214}</span> like Sigonius found themselves tied down in their
    class-rooms to a weariful routine of Cicero and Aristotle. Aonio Paleario complained
    that a professor was no better than a donkey working in a mill; nothing remained for
    him but to dole out commonplaces, avoiding every point of contact between the authors
    he interpreted and the burning questions of modern life. Muretus, who brought with
    him to Italy from France a ruined moral reputation with a fervid zeal for literature,
    who sold his soul to praise the Massacre of S. Bartholomew and purge by fulsome
    panegyrics of great public crimes the taint of heresy that clung around him, found
    his efforts to extend the course of studies in Rome thwarted.<a
    name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138"
    class="fnanchor">[138]</a> He was forbidden to lecture on Plato, forbidden to touch
    jurisprudence, forbidden to consult a copy of Eunapius in the Vatican Library. It
    cost him days and weeks of pleading to obtain permission to read Tacitus to his
    classes. Greek, the literature of high thoughts, noble enthusiasms, and virile
    sciences, was viewed with suspicion. As the monks of the middle ages had written on
    the margins of their MSS.: <i>Graeca sunt, ergo non legenda</i>, so these new
    obscurantists exclaimed: <i>Graeca sunt, periculosa sunt, ergo non legenda</i>. 'I am
    forced,' he cries in this extremity, 'to occupy myself with Latin and to abstain
    entirely from Greek.' And yet he knew that 'if the men of our age advance one step
    further in their neglect of Greek, doom and destruction are <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page215" id="page215"></a>{215}</span> impending over all sound arts and
    sciences.' 'It is my misery,' he groans, 'to behold the gradual extinction and total
    decay of Greek letters, in whose train I see the whole body of refined learning on
    the point of vanishing away.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
    <p>A vigorous passage from one of Sarpi's letters directly bearing on these points
    may here be cited (vol. i. p. 170): 'The revival of polite learning undermined the
    foundations of Papal monarchy. Nor was this to be wondered at. This monarchy began
    and grew in barbarism; the cessation of barbarism naturally curtailed and threatened
    it with extinction. This we already see in Germany and France; but Spain and Italy
    are still subject to barbarism. Legal studies sink daily from bad to worse. The Roman
    Curia opposes every branch of learning which savors of polite literature, while it
    defends its barbarism with tooth and nail. How can it do otherwise? Abolish those
    books on Papal Supremacy, and where shall they find that the Pope is another God,
    that he is almighty, that all rights and laws are closed within the cabinet of his
    breast, that he can shut up folk in hell, in a word that he has power to square the
    circle? Destroy that false jurisprudence, and this tyranny will vanish; but the two
    are reciprocally supporting, and we shall not do away with the former until the
    latter falls, which will only happen at God's good pleasure.'</p>
    <p>The jealousy with which liberal studies were <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> regarded by the Church bred a contempt
    for them in the minds of students. Benci, a professor of humane letters at Rome, says
    that his pupils walked about the class-room during his lectures. With grim humor he
    adds that he does not object to their sleeping, so long as they abstain from
    snoring.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> But it is impossible, he goes on
    to complain, that I should any longer look upon the place in which I do my daily work
    as an academy of learning; I go to it rather as to a mill in which I must grind out
    my tale of worthless grain. Muretus, when he had labored twenty years in the chair of
    rhetoric at Rome, begged for dismissal. His memorial to the authorities presents a
    lamentable picture of the insubordination and indifference from which he had
    suffered.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> 'I have borne immeasurable
    indignities from the continued insolence of these students, who interrupt me with
    cries, whistlings, hisses, insults, and such opprobrious remarks that I sometimes
    scarcely know whether I am standing on my head or heels.' 'They come to the
    lecture-room armed with poignards, and when I reprove them for their indecencies,
    they threaten over and over again to cut my face open if I do not hold my tongue.'
    The walls, he adds, are scrawled over with obscene emblems and disgusting epigrams,
    so that this haunt of learning presents the aspect of the lowest brothel; and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>{217}</span> the professor's chair
    has become a more intolerable seat than the pillory, owing to the missiles flung at
    him and the ribaldry with which he is assailed. The manners and conversation of the
    students must have been disgusting beyond measure, to judge by a letter of complaint
    from a father detailing the contamination to which his son was exposed in the Roman
    class-rooms, and the immunity with which the lewdest songs were publicly recited
    there.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> But the total degradation of
    learning at this epoch in Rome is best described in one paragraph of Vittorio
    de'Rossi, setting forth the neglect endured by Aldo Manuzio, the younger. This scion
    of an illustrious family succeeded to the professorship of Muretus in 1588. 'Then,'
    says Rossi, 'might one marvel at or rather mourn over, the abject and down-trodden
    state of the liberal arts. Then might one perceive with tears how those treasures of
    humane letters, which our fathers exalted to the heavens, were degraded in the
    estimation of youth. In the good old days men crossed the seas, undertook long
    journeys, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>{218}</span>
    traversed the cities of Greece and Asia, in order to obtain the palm of eloquence and
    salute the masters of languages and learning, at whose feet they sat entranced by
    noble words. But now these fellows poured scorn upon an unrivaled teacher of both
    Greek and Latin eloquence, whose services were theirs for the asking, theirs without
    the fatigue of travel, without expense, without exertion. Though he freely offered
    them his abundance of erudition in both learned literatures, they shut their ears
    against him. At the hours when his lecture-room should have been thronged with
    multitudes of eager pupils you might see him, abandoned by the crowd, pacing the
    pavement before the door of the academy with one, or may be two, for his
    companions.'<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
    <p>To accuse the Church solely and wholly for this decay of humanistic learning in
    Italy would be uncritical and unjust. We must remember that after a period of
    feverish energy there comes a time of languor in all epochs of great intellectual
    excitement. Nor was it to be expected that the enthusiasm of the fifteenth century
    for classical studies should have been prolonged into the second half of the
    sixteenth century. But we are justified in blaming the ecclesiastical and civil
    authorities of the Counter-Reformation for their determined opposition to the new
    direction which that old enthusiasm for the classics was now manifesting. They strove
    to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>{219}</span> force the
    stream of learning backward into scholastic and linguistic channels, when it was
    already plowing for itself a fresh course in the fields of philosophical and
    scientific discovery. They made study odious, because they attempted to restrain it
    to the out-worn husks of pedantry and rhetoric. These, they thought, were innocuous.
    But what the intellectual appetite then craved, the pabulum that it required to
    satisfy its yearning, was rigidly denied it. Speculations concerning the nature of
    man and of the world, metaphysical explorations into the regions of dimly apprehended
    mysteries, physics, political problems, religious questions touching the great
    matters in dispute through Europe, all the storm and stress of modern life, the
    ferment of the modern mind and will and conscience, were excluded from the schools,
    because they were antagonistic to the Counter-Reformation. Italy was starved and
    demoralized in order to avert a revolution; and learning was asphyxiated by
    confinement to a narrow chamber filled with vitiated and exhausted air.<a
    name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144"
    class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>
    <p>Similar deductions may be drawn from the life of Paolo Manuzio in Rome. He left
    Venice in 1561 at the invitation of Pius IV., who proposed to establish a press 'for
    the publication of books printed with the finest type and the utmost accuracy, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>{220}</span> more especially
    of works bearing upon sacred and ecclesiastical literature.'<a
    name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145"
    class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Paolo's engagement was for twelve years; his appointments
    were fixed at 300 ducats for traveling expenses, 500 ducats of yearly salary, a press
    maintained at the Pontifical expense, and a pension secured upon his son's life. The
    scheme was a noble one. Paolo was to print all the Greek and Latin Fathers, and to
    furnish the Catholic world with an arsenal of orthodox learning. Yet, during his
    residence in Rome, no Greek book issued from his press.<a name="FNanchor_146_146"
    id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Of
    the Latin Fathers he gave the Epistles of Jerome, Salvian, and Cyprian to the world.
    For the rest, he published the Decrees of the Tridentine Council ten times, the
    Tridentine Catechism eight times, the <i>Breviarium Romanum</i> four times, and spent
    the greater part of his leisure in editing minor translations, commentaries, and
    polemical or educational treatises. The result was miserable, and the man was
    ruined.</p>
    <p>It remains to notice the action of the Index with regard to secular books in the
    modern languages. I will first repeat a significant passage in its statutes touching
    upon political philosophy and the so-called <i>Ratio Status</i>: 'Item, let all
    propositions, drawn from the digests, manners, and examples of the Gentiles, which
    foster a tyrannical polity and encourage what they falsely call the reason of state,
    in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>{221}</span> opposition
    to the law of Christ and of the Gospel, be expunged.' This, says Sarpi in his
    Discourse on Printing, is aimed in general against any doctrine which impugns
    ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the civil sphere of princes and magistrates, and the
    economy of the family.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Theories drawn from whatever
    source to combat Papal and ecclesiastical encroachments, and to defend the rights of
    the sovereign in his monarchy or of the father in his, household, are denominated and
    denounced as <i>Ratio Status</i>. The impugner of Papal absolutism in civil, as well
    as ecclesiastical affairs, is accounted <i>ipso facto</i> a heretic.<a
    name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148"
    class="fnanchor">[148]</a> It would appear at first sight as though the clause in
    question had been specially framed to condemn Machiavelli and his school. The works
    of Machiavelli were placed upon the Index in 1559, and a certain Cesare of Pisa who
    had them in his library was put to the torture on this account in 1610. It was
    afterwards proposed to correct and edit them without his name; but his heirs very
    properly refused to sanction this proceeding, knowing that he would be made to utter
    the very reverse of what he meant in all that touched upon the Roman Church.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span></p>
    <p>This paragraph in the statutes of the Index had, however, a further and far more
    ambitious purpose than the suppression of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and Sarpi. By
    assuming to condemn all political writings of which she disapproved, and by
    forbidding the secular authorities to proscribe any works which had received her
    sanction, the Church obtained a monopoly of popular instruction in theories of
    government. She interdicted every treatise that exposed her own ambitious
    interference in civil affairs or which maintained the rights of temporal rulers.<a
    name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149"
    class="fnanchor">[149]</a> She protected and propagated the works of her servile
    ministers, who proclaimed that the ecclesiastical was superior in all points to the
    civil power; that nations owed their first allegiance to the Pope, who was divinely
    appointed to rule over them, and their second only to the Prince, who was a delegate
    from their own body; and that tyrannicide itself was justifiable when employed
    against a contumacious or heretical sovereign. Such were the theories of the
    Jesuits&mdash;of Allen and Parsons in England, Bellarmino in Italy, Suarez and
    Mariana in Spain, Boucher in France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"
    id="page223"></a>{223}</span></p>
    <p>In his critique of this monstrous unfairness Sarpi says: 'There are not wanting
    men in Italy, pious and of sound learning, who hold the truth upon such topics; but
    these can neither write nor send their writings to the press.'<a
    name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150"
    class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The best years and the best energies of Sarpi's life were
    spent, as is well known, in combating the arrogance of Rome, and in founding the
    relations of State to Church upon a basis of sound common sense and equity. More than
    once he narrowly escaped martyrdom as the reward of his temerity; and when the
    poignard of an assassin struck him, his legend relates that he uttered the celebrated
    epigram: <i>Agnosco stilum Curiae Romanae</i>.</p>
    <p>Sarpi protested, not without good reason, that Rome was doing her best to
    extinguish sound learning in Italy. But how did she deal with that rank growth of
    licentious literature which had sprung up during the Renaissance period? This is the
    question which should next engage us. We have seen that the Council of Trent provided
    amply for the extirpation of lewd and obscene publications. Accordingly, as though to
    satisfy the sense of decency, some of the most flagrantly immoral books, including
    the <i>Decameron</i>, the <i>Priapeia</i>, the collected works of Aretino, and
    certain mediaeval romances, were placed upon the Index. Berni was proscribed in 1559;
    but the interdict lasted only a short time, probably <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page224" id="page224"></a>{224}</span> because it was discovered that his
    poems, though licentious, were free from the heresies which Pier Paolo Vergerio had
    sought to fix upon him. Meanwhile no notice was taken of the <i>Orlando Furioso</i>,
    and a multitude of novelists, of Beccadelli's and Pontano's verses, of Molza and
    Firenzuola, of the whole mass of mundane writers in short, who had done so much to
    reveal the corruption of Italian manners. It seemed as though the Church cared less
    to ban obscenity than to burke those authors who had spoken freely of her vices. When
    we come to examine the expurgated editions of notorious authors, we shall see that
    this was literally the case. A castrated version of Bandello, revised by Ascanio
    Centorio degli Ortensi, was published in 1560.<a name="FNanchor_151_151"
    id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> It
    omitted the dedications and preambles, suppressed some disquisitions which palliated
    vicious conduct, expunged the novels that brought monks or priests into ridicule, but
    left the impurities of the rest untouched. A reformed version of Folengo's
    <i>Baldus</i> appeared in 1561. The satires on religious orders had been erased.
    Zambellus was cuckolded by a layman instead of a priest. Otherwise the filth of the
    original received no cleansing treatment. When Cosimo de'Medici requested that a
    revised edition of the <i>Decameron</i> might be licensed, Pius V. entrusted the
    affair to Thomas Manrique, Master of the Sacred Palace. It was published by the
    Giunti in 1573 under the auspices of Gregory XIII., with the ap<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>{225}</span> proval of the Holy
    Office and the Florentine Inquisition, fortified by privileges from Spanish and
    French kings, dukes of Tuscany, Ferrara, and so forth. The changes which Boccaccio's
    masterpiece had undergone were these: passages savoring of doubtful dogma, sarcasms
    on monks and clergy, the names of saints, allusions to the devil and hell, had
    disappeared. Ecclesiastical sinners were transformed into students and professors,
    nuns and abbesses into citizens' wives. Immorality in short was secularized. But the
    book still offered the same allurements to a prurient mind. Sixtus V. expressed his
    disapproval of this recension, and new editions were licensed in 1582 and 1588 under
    the revision of Lionardo Salviati and Luigi Groto. Both preserved the obscenities of
    the <i>Decameron</i>, while they displayed more rigor with regard to satires on
    ecclesiastical corruption. It may be added, in justice to the Roman Church, that the
    <i>Decameron</i> stands still upon the Index with the annotation <i>donec
    expurgetur</i>.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> Therefore we must presume that
    the work of purification is not yet accomplished, though the Jesuits have used parts
    of it as a text-book in their schools, while Panigarola quoted it in his lectures on
    sacred eloquence.</p>
    <p>It would weary the reader to enlarge upon this process of stupid or hypocritical
    purgation, whereby the writings of men like Doni and Straparola were stripped of
    their reflections on the clergy, while their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"
    id="page226"></a>{226}</span> indecencies remained untouched; or to show how
    Ariosto's Comedies were sanctioned, when his Satires, owing to their free speech upon
    the Papal Court, received the stigma.<a name="FNanchor_153_153"
    id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> But
    I may refer to the grotesque attempts which were made in this age to cast the mantle
    of spirituality over profane literature. Thus Hieronimo Malipieri rewrote the
    <i>Canzoniere</i> of Petrarch, giving it a pious turn throughout; and the <i>Orlando
    Furioso</i> was converted by several hands into a religious allegory.<a
    name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154"
    class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>
    <p>The action of Rome under the influence of the Counter-Reformation was clearly
    guided by two objects: to preserve Catholic dogma in its integrity, and to maintain
    the supremacy of the Church. She was eager to extinguish learning and to paralyze
    intellectual energy. But she showed no unwillingness to tolerate those pleasant vices
    which enervate a nation. Compared with unsound doctrine and audacious speculation,
    immorality appeared in her eyes a venial weakness. It was true that she made serious
    efforts to reform the manners of her ministers, and was fully alive to the necessity
    of enforcing decency and decorum. Yet a radical purification of society seemed of
    less importance to her than the conservation of Catholic orthodoxy and the
    inculca<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>{227}</span> tion of
    obedience to ecclesiastical authority. When we analyze the Jesuits' system of
    education, and their method of conducting the care of souls, we shall see to what
    extent the deeply seated hypocrisy of the Counter-Reformation had penetrated the most
    vital parts of the Catholic system. It will suffice, at the close of this chapter, to
    touch upon one other repressive measure adopted by the Church in its panic.
    Magistrates received strict injunctions to impede the journeys of Italian subjects
    into foreign countries where heresies were known to be rife, or where the rites of
    the Roman Church were not regularly administered.<a name="FNanchor_155_155"
    id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In
    1595 Clement VIII. reduced these admonitions to Pontifical law in a Bull, whereby he
    forbade Italians to travel without permission from the Holy Office, or to reside
    abroad without annually remitting a certificate of confession and communion to the
    Inquisitors. To ensure obedience to this statute would have been impossible without
    the co-operation of the Jesuits. They were, however, diffused throughout the nations
    of North, East, South, and West. When an Italian arrived, the Jesuit Fathers paid him
    a visit, and unless they received satisfactory answers with regard to his license of
    travel and his willingness to accept <span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"
    id="page228"></a>{228}</span> their spiritual direction, these serfs of Rome sent a
    delation to the central Holy Office, upon the ground of which the Inquisitors of his
    province instituted an action against him in his absence. Merchants, who neglected
    these rules, found themselves exposed to serious impediments in their trading
    operations, and to the peril of prosecution involving confiscation of property at
    home. Sarpi, who composed a vigorous critique of this abuse, points out what injury
    was done to commerce by the system.<a name="FNanchor_156_156"
    id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> We
    may still further censure it as an intolerable interference with the liberty of the
    individual; as an odious exercise of spiritual tyranny on the part of an ambitious
    ecclesiastical power which aimed at nothing less than universal domination.</p>

    <p>We have seen in the preceding chapters how Spain became dominant in Italy,
    superseding the rivalry of confederate states by the monotony of servitude, and
    lending its weight to Papal Rome. The internal changes effected in the Church by the
    Tridentine Council, and the external power conferred <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page230" id="page230"></a>{230}</span> on it, were due in no small measure to
    Spanish influence or sanction. A Spanish institution, the Inquisition, modified to
    suit Italian requirements, lent revived Catholicism weapons of repression and attack.
    We have now to learn by what means a partial vigor was communicated to the failing
    body of Catholic beliefs, how the Tridentine creed was propagated, the spiritual
    realm of the Roman Pontiff policed, and his secular authority augmented. A Spanish
    Order rose at the right moment to supply that intellectual and moral element of
    vitality without which the Catholic Revival might have remained as inert as a
    stillborn child. The devotion of the Jesuits to the Papacy, was in reality the
    masterful Spanish spirit of that epoch, masking its world-grasping ambition under the
    guise of obedience to Rome. This does not mean that the founders and first organizers
    of the Company of Jesus consciously pursued one object while they pretended to have
    another in view. The impulse which moved Loyola was spontaneous and romantic. The
    world has seen few examples of disinterested self-devotion equal to that of Xavier.
    Yet the fact remains that Jesuitry, taking its germ and root in the Spanish
    character, persisting as an organism within the Church, but separate from the
    ecclesiastical hierarchy, devised the doctrine of Papal absolutism, and became the
    prime agent of that Catholic policy in Europe which passed for Papal during the
    Counter-Reformation. The indissoluble connection between Rome,<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>{231}</span> Spain, and the
    Jesuits, was apparent to all unprejudiced observers. For this triad of reactionary
    and belligerent forces Sarpi invented the name of the Diacatholicon, alluding, under
    the metaphor of a drug, to the virus which was being instilled in his days into all
    the States of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>
    <p>The founder of the Jesuit order was the thirteenth child of a Spanish noble, born
    in 1491 at his father's castle of Loyola in the Basque province of Guipuzcoa.<a
    name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158"
    class="fnanchor">[158]</a> His full name was I&ntilde;igo Lopez de Recalde; but he is
    better known to history as Saint Ignatius Loyola. Ignatius spent his boyhood as page
    in the service of King Ferdinand the Catholic, whence he passed into that of the Duke
    of Najara, who was the hereditary friend and patron of his family. At this time he
    thought of nothing but feats of arms, military glory, and romantic adventures.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span></p>
    <p>He could boast but little education; and his favorite reading was in <i>Amadis of
    Gaul</i>. That romance appeared during the boy's earliest childhood, and Spain was
    now devouring its high-flown rhapsodies with rapture. The peculiar admixture of
    mystical piety, Catholic enthusiasm, and chivalrous passion, which distinguishes
    <i>Amadis</i>, exactly corresponded to the spirit of the Spaniards at an epoch when
    they had terminated their age-long struggle with the Moors, and were combining
    propagandist zeal with martial fervor in the conquest of the New World. Its pages
    inflamed the imagination of Ignatius. He began to compose a romance in honor of S.
    Peter, and chose a princess of blood royal for his Oriana. Thus, in the first days of
    youth, while his heart was still set on love and warfare, he revealed the three
    leading features of his character&mdash;soaring ambition, the piety of a devotee, and
    the tendency to view religion from the point of fiction.</p>
    <p>Ignatius was barely twenty when the events happened which determined the future of
    his life and so powerfully affected the destinies of Catholic Christendom. The French
    were invading Navarre; and he was engaged in the defense of its capital, Pampeluna.
    On May 20, 1521, a bullet shattered his right leg, while his left foot was injured by
    a fragment of stone detached from a breach in the bastion. Transported to his
    father's castle, he suffered protracted anguish under the hands of unskilled medical
    attendants. The badly set bone <span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"
    id="page233"></a>{233}</span> in his right leg had twice to be broken; and when at
    last it joined, the young knight found himself a cripple. This limb was shorter than
    the other; the surgeons endeavored to elongate it by machines of iron, which put him
    to exquisite pain. After months of torture, he remained lame for life.</p>
    <p>During his illness Ignatius read such books as the castle of Loyola contained.
    These were a 'Life of Christ' and the 'Flowers of the Saints' in Spanish. His mind,
    prepared by chivalrous romance, and strongly inclined to devotion, felt a special
    fascination in the tales of Dominic and Francis. Their heroism suggested new paths
    which the aspirant after fame might tread with honor. Military glory and the love of
    women had to be renounced; for so ambitious a man could not content himself with the
    successes of a cripple in these spheres of action. But the legends of saints and
    martyrs pointed out careers no less noble, no less useful, and even more enticing to
    the fancy. He would become the spiritual Knight of Christ and Our Lady. To S. Peter,
    his chosen protector, he prayed fervently; and when at length he rose from the bed of
    sickness, he firmly believed that his life had been saved by the intercession of this
    patron, and that it must be henceforth consecrated to the service of the faith. The
    world should be abandoned. Instead of warring with the enemies of Christ on earth, he
    would carry on a crusade against the powers of darkness. They were first to be met
    and fought in his own <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"
    id="page234"></a>{234}</span> heart. Afterwards, he would form and lead a militia of
    like-hearted champions against the strongholds of evil in human nature.</p>
    <p>It must not be thought that the scheme of founding a Society had so early entered
    into the mind of Ignatius. What we have at the present stage to notice is that he
    owed his adoption of the religious life to romantic fancy and fervid ambition,
    combined with a devotion to Peter, the saint of orthodoxy and the Church. Animated by
    this new enthusiasm, he managed to escape from home in the spring of 1522. His
    friends opposed themselves to his vocation; but he gave them the slip, took vows of
    chastity and abstinence, and began a pilgrimage to our Lady of Montserrat near
    Barcelona. On the road he scourged himself daily. When he reached the shrine he hung
    his arms up as a votive offering, and performed the vigil which chivalrous custom
    exacted from a squire before the morning of his being dubbed a knight. This ceremony
    was observed point by point, according to the ritual he had read in <i>Amadis of
    Gaul</i>. Next day he gave his raiment to a beggar, and assumed the garb of a
    mendicant pilgrim. By self-dedication he had now made himself the Knight of Holy
    Church.</p>
    <p>His first intention was to set sail for Palestine, with the object of preaching to
    the infidels. But the plague prevented him from leaving port; and he retired to a
    Dominican convent at Manresa, a little town of Catalonia, north-west of Barcelona.
    Here <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>{235}</span> he
    abandoned himself to the crudest self-discipline. Feeding upon bread and water,
    kneeling for seven hours together rapt in prayer, scourging his flesh thrice daily,
    and reducing sleep to the barest minimum, Ignatius sought by austerity to snatch that
    crown of sainthood which he felt to be his due. Outraged nature soon warned him that
    he was upon a path which led to failure. Despair took possession of his soul,
    sometimes prompting him to end his life by suicide, sometimes plaguing him with
    hideous visions. At last he fell dangerously ill. Enlightened by the expectation of
    early death, he then became convinced that his fanatical asceticism was a folly. The
    despair, the dreadful phantoms which had haunted him, were ascribed immediately to
    the devil. In those rarer visitings of brighter visions, which sometimes brought
    consolation, bidding him repose upon God's mercy, he recognized angels sent to lead
    him on the pathway of salvation. God's hand appeared in these dealings; and he
    resolved to dedicate his body as well as his soul to God's service, respecting both
    as instruments of the divine will, and entertaining both in efficiency for the work
    required of them.</p>
    <p>The experiences of Manresa proved eminently fruitful for the future method of
    Ignatius. It was here that he began to regard self-discipline and self-examination as
    the needful prelude to a consecrated life. It was here that he learned to condemn the
    ascetism of anchorites as pernicious or unprofitable to a militant Christian. It was
    here that, while studying <span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"
    id="page236"></a>{236}</span> the manual of devotion written by Garcia de Cisneros,
    he laid foundations for those famous <i>Exercitia</i>, which became his instrument
    for rapidly passing neophytes through spiritual training similar to his own. It was
    here that he first distinguished two kinds of visions, infernal and celestial. Here
    also he grew familiar with the uses of concrete imagination;, and understood how the
    faculty of sensuous realization might be made a powerful engine for presenting the
    past of sacred history or the dogmas of orthodox theology under shapes of fancy to
    the mind. Finally, in all the experiences of Manresa, he tried the temper of his own
    character, which was really not that of a poet or a mystic, but of a sagacious man of
    action, preparing a system calculated to subjugate the intelligence and will of
    millions. Tested by self-imposed sufferings and by diseased hallucinations, his sound
    sense, the sense of one destined to control men, gathered energy, and grew in, solid
    strength: yet enough remained of his fanaticism to operate as a motive force in the
    scheme which he afterwards developed; enough survived from the ascetic phase he had
    surmounted, to make him comprehend that some such agony as he had suffered should
    form the vestibule to a devoted life. We may compare the throes of Ignatius at
    Manresa with the contemporary struggles of Luther at Wittenberg and in the Wartzburg.
    Our imagination will dwell upon the different issues to which two heroes
    distinguished by practical ability were led <span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"
    id="page237"></a>{237}</span> through their contention with the powers of spiritual
    evil. Protagonists respectively of Reformation and Counter-Reformation, they arrived
    at opposite conclusions; the one championing the cause of spiritual freedom in the
    modern world, the other consecrating his genius to the maintenance of Catholic
    orthodoxy by spiritual despotism. Yet each alike fulfilled his mission by having
    conquered mysticism at the outset of his world-historical career.</p>
    <p>Ignatius remained for the space of ten months at Manresa. He then found means to
    realize his cherished journey to the Holy Land. In Palestine he was treated with
    coldness as an ignorant enthusiast, capable of subverting the existing order of
    things, but too feeble to be counted on for permanent support. His motive ideas were
    still visionary; he could not cope with conservatism and frigidity established in
    comfortable places of emolument. It was necessary that he should learn the wisdom of
    compromise. Accordingly he returned to Spain, and put himself to school. Two years
    spent in preparatory studies at Barcelona, another period at Alcala, and another at
    Salamanca, introduced him to languages, grammar, philosophy, and theology. This man
    of noble blood and vast ambition, past the age of thirty, sat with boys upon the
    common benches. This self-consecrated saint imbibed the commonplaces of scholastic
    logic. It was a further stage in the evolution of his iron character from romance and
    mysticism, into political and practical sagacity. It <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page238" id="page238"></a>{238}</span> was a further education of his stubborn
    will to pliant temper. But he could not divest himself of his mission as a founder
    and apostle. He taught disciples, preached, and formed a sect of devotees. Then the
    Holy Office attacked him. He was imprisoned, once at Alcala for forty-two days, once
    at Salamanca for three weeks, upon charges of heresy. Ignatius proved his innocence.
    The Inquisitors released him with certificates of acquittal; but they sentenced him
    to four years' study of theology before he should presume to preach. These years he
    resolved to spend at Paris. Accordingly he performed the journey on foot, and arrived
    in the capital of France upon February 2, 1528. He was then thirty-seven years old,
    and sixteen years had elapsed since he received his wounds at Pampeluna.</p>
    <p>At Paris he had to go to school again from the beginning. The alms of
    well-wishers, chiefly devout women at Barcelona, amply provided him with funds. These
    he employed not only in advancing his own studies, but also in securing the
    attachment of adherents to his cause. At this epoch he visited the towns of Belgium
    and London during his vacations. But the main outcome of his residence at Paris was
    the formation of the Company of Jesus. Those long years of his novitiate and
    wandering were not without their uses now. They had taught him, while clinging
    stubbornly to the main projects of his life, prudence in the choice of means,
    temperance in expectation, sagacity in the manipulation of fellow-<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>{239}</span> workers selected for
    the still romantic ends he had in view. His first two disciples were a Savoyard,
    Peter Faber or Le F&egrave;vre, and Francis Xavier of Pampeluna. Faber was a poor
    student, whom Ignatius helped with money. Xavier sprang from a noble stock, famous in
    arms through generations, for which he was eager to win the additional honors of
    science and the Church. Ignatius assisted him by bringing students to his lectures.
    Under the personal influence of their friend and benefactor, both of these men
    determined to leave all and follow the new light. Visionary as the object yet was,
    the firm will, fervent confidence, and saintly life of Loyola inspired them with
    absolute trust. That the Christian faith, as they understood it, remained exposed to
    grievous dangers from without and form within, that millions of souls were perishing
    through ignorance, that tens of thousands were falling away through incredulity and
    heresy, was certain. The realm of Christ on earth needed champions, soldiers devoted
    to a crusade against Satan and his hosts. And here was a leader, a man among men, a
    man whose words were as a fire, and whose method of spiritual discipline was salutary
    and illuminative; and this man bade them join him in the Holy War. He gained them in
    a hundred ways, by kindness, by precept, by patience, by persuasion, by attention to
    their physical and spiritual needs, by words of warmth and wisdom, by the direction
    of their conscience, by profound and intense sympathy with <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page240" id="page240"></a>{240}</span> souls struggling after the higher life.
    The means he had employed to gain Faber and Xavier were used with equal success in
    the case of seven other disciples. The names of these men deserve to be recorded; for
    some of them played a part of importance in European history, while all of them
    contributed to the foundation of the Jesuits. They were James Lainez, Alfonzo
    Salmeron, and Nicholas Bobadilla, three Spaniards; Simon Rodriguez d'Azevedo, a
    Portuguese; two Frenchmen, Jean Codure and Brouet; and Claude le Jay, a Savoyard. All
    these neophytes were subjected by Ignatius to rigid discipline, based upon his
    <i>Exercitia</i>. They met together for prayer, meditation, and discussion, in his
    chamber at the College of S. Barbe. Here he unfolded to them his own plans, and
    poured out on them his spirit. At length, upon August 15, 1534, the ten together took
    the vows of chastity and poverty in the church of S. Mary at Montmartre, and bound
    themselves to conduct a missionary crusade in Palestine, or, if this should prove
    impracticable, to place themselves as devoted instruments, without conditions and
    without remuneration, in the hands of the Sovereign Pontiff.</p>
    <p>The society was thus established, although its purpose remained indecisive. The
    founder's romantic dream of a crusade in Holy Land, though never realized, gave an
    object of immediate interest to the associated friends. Meanwhile two main features
    of its historical manifestation, the propaganda of the<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page241" id="page241"></a>{241}</span> Catholic faith and unqualified devotion
    to the cause of the Roman See, had been clearly indicated. Nothing proves the mastery
    which Ignatius had now acquired over his own enthusiasm, or the insight he had gained
    into the right method of dealing with men, more than the use he made of his authority
    in this first instance. The society was bound to grow and to expand; and it was fated
    to receive the lasting impress of his genius. But, as though inspired by some
    prophetic vision of its future greatness, he refrained from circumscribing the still
    tender embryo within definite limits which might have been pernicious to its
    development.</p>
    <p>The associates completed their studies at Paris, and in 1535 they separated, after
    agreeing to meet at Venice in the first months of 1537. Ignatius meanwhile traveled
    to Spain, where he settled his affairs by bestowing such property as he possessed on
    charitable institutions. He also resumed preaching, with a zeal that aroused
    enthusiasm and extended his personal influence. At the appointed time the ten came
    together at Venice, ostensibly bent on carrying out their project of visiting
    Palestine. But war was now declared between the Turks and the Republic of S. Mark.
    Ignatius found himself once more accused of heresy, and had some trouble in clearing
    himself before the Inquisition. It was resolved in these circumstances to abandon the
    mission to Holy Land as impracticable for the moment, and to remain in Venice waiting
    for more <span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>{242}</span>
    favorable opportunities. We may believe that the romance of a crusade among the
    infidels of Syria had already begun to fade from the imagination of the founder, in
    whose career nothing is more striking than his gradual abandonment of visionary for
    tangible ends, and his progressive substitution of real for shadowy objects of
    ambition.</p>
    <p>Loyola's first contact with Italian society during this residence in Venice
    exercised decisive influence over his plans. He seems to have perceived with the
    acute scent of an eagle that here lay the quarry he had sought so long. Italy, the
    fountain-head of intellectual enlightenment for Europe, was the realm which he must
    win. Italy alone offered the fulcrum needed by his firm and limitless desire of
    domination over souls. It was with Caraffa and the Theatines that Ignatius obtained a
    home. They were now established in the States of S. Mark through the beneficence of a
    rich Venetian noble, Girolamo Miani, who had opened religious houses and placed these
    at their disposition. Under the direction of their founder, they carried on their
    designed function of training a higher class of clergy for the duties of preaching
    and the priesthood, and for the repression of heresy by educational means. Caraffa's
    scheme was too limited to suit Ignatius: and the characters of both men were ill
    adapted for co-operation. One zeal for the faith inspired both. Here they agreed. But
    Ignatius was a Spaniard; and the second passion in Caraffa's <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span> breast was a Neapolitan's hatred for
    that nation. Ignatius, moreover, contemplated a vastly more expansive and elastic
    machinery for his workers in the vineyard of the faith, than the future Pope's
    coercive temper could have tolerated. These two leaders of the Counter-Reformation,
    equally ambitious, equally intolerant of opposition, equally bent upon a vast
    dominion, had to separate. The one was destined to organize the Inquisition and the
    Index. The other evolved what is historically known as Jesuitry. Nevertheless we know
    that Ignatius learned much from Caraffa. The subsequent organization of his Order
    showed that the Theatines suggested many practical points in the method he eventually
    adopted for effecting his designs.</p>
    <p>Some of his companions, meanwhile, journeyed to Rome. There they obtained from
    Paul III. permission to visit Palestine upon a missionary enterprise, together with
    special privileges for their entrance into sacerdotal orders. Those of the ten
    friends who were not yet priests, were ordained at Venice in June 1537. They then
    began to preach in public, roaming the streets with faces emaciated by abstinence,
    clad in ragged clothes, and using a language strangely compounded of Italian and
    Spanish. Their obvious enthusiasm, and the holy lives they were known to lead,
    brought them rapidly into high reputation of sanctity. Both the secular and the
    religious clergy of Italy could <span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"
    id="page244"></a>{244}</span> show but few men at that epoch equal to these brethren.
    It was settled in the autumn that they should all revisit Rome, traveling by
    different routes, and meditating on the form which the Order should assume. Palestine
    had now been definitely, if tacitly, abandoned. As might have been expected, it was
    Loyola who baptized his Order, and impressed a character upon the infant institution.
    He determined to call it the Company of Jesus, with direct reference to those
    Companies of Adventure which had given irregular organization to restless military
    spirits in the past. The new Company was to be a 'cohort, or century, combined for
    combat against spiritual foes; men-at-arms, devoted, body and soul, to our Lord Jesus
    Christ and to his true and lawful Vicar upon earth.'<a name="FNanchor_159_159"
    id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> An
    Englishman of the present day may pause to meditate upon the grotesque parallel
    between the nascent Order of the Jesuits and the Salvation Army, and can draw such
    conclusions from it as may seem profitable.</p>
    <p>Loyola's withdrawal from all participation in the nominal honor of his
    institution, his enrollment of the militia he had levied under the name of Jesus, and
    the combative functions which he ascribed to it, were very decided marks of
    originality. It stamped the body with impersonality from the outset, and indicated
    the belligerent attitude it was destined to assume. There was nothing exactly similar
    to its dominant conception in any of the previous religious <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page245" id="page245"></a>{245}</span> orders. These had usually received their
    title from the founder, had aimed at a life retired from the world, had studied the
    sanctification of their individual members, and had only contemplated an indirect
    operation upon society. Ignatius, on the contrary, placed his community under the
    protection of Christ, and defined it at the outset as a militant and movable legion
    of auxiliaries, dedicated, not to retirement or to the pursuit of salvation, but to
    freely avowed and active combat in defense of their Master's vicegerent upon earth.
    It was as though he had divined the deficiencies of Catholicism at that epoch, and
    had determined to supplement them by the creation of a novel and a special weapon of
    attack. Some institutions of mediaeval chivalry, the Knights of the Temple, and S.
    John, for instance, furnished the closest analogy to his foundation. Their spirit he
    transferred from the sphere of physical combat with visible forces, infidel and
    Mussulman, to the sphere of intellectual warfare against heresy, unbelief,
    insubordination in the Church. He had refined upon the crude enthusiasm of romance
    which inspired him at Montserrat. Without losing its intensity, this had become a
    motive force of actual and political gravity.</p>
    <p>The Company of Jesus was far from obtaining the immediate approval of the Church.
    Paul III. indeed, perceived its utility, and showed marked favor to the associates
    when they arrived in Rome about the end of 1537. The people, too, welcomed <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> their ministration
    gladly, and recognized the zeal which they displayed in acts of charity and their
    exemplary behavior. But the Curia and higher clergy organized an opposition against
    them. They were accused of heresy, and attempts to seduce the common folk. Ignatius
    demanded full and public inquiry, which was at first refused him. He then addressed
    the Pope in person, who ordered a trial, out of which the brethren came with full
    acquittal. After this success, they obtained a hold upon religious instruction in
    many schools of Rome. Adherents flocked around them; and they saw that it was time to
    give the society a defined organization, and to demand its official recognition as an
    Order. It was resolved to add the vow of obedience to their former vows of chastity
    and poverty. Obedience had always been a prime virtue in monastic institutions; but
    Ignatius conceived of it in a new and military spirit. The obedience of the Jesuits
    was to be absolute, extending even to the duty of committing sins at a superior's
    orders. The General, instead of holding office for a term of years, was to be elected
    for life, with unlimited command over the whole Order in its several degrees. He was
    to be regarded as Christ present and personified. This autocracy of the General might
    have seemed to menace the overlordship of the Holy See, but for a fourth vow which
    the Company determined to adopt. It ran as follows: 'That the members will consecrate
    their lives to the continual service of Christ and of the Popes, will fight under the
    banner of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>{247}</span>
    Cross, and will serve the Lord and the Roman Pontiff as God's vicar upon earth, in
    such wise that they shall be bound to execute immediately and without hesitation or
    excuse all that the reigning Pope or his successors may enjoin upon them for the
    profit of souls or for the propagation of the faith, and shall do so in all provinces
    whithersoever he may send them, among Turks or any other infidels, to furthest Ind,
    as well as in the region of heretics, schismatics, or believers of any kind.'</p>
    <p>Loyola himself drew up these constitutions in five chapters, and had them
    introduced to Paul III., with the petition that they might be confirmed. This was in
    September 1539, and it is singular that the man selected to bring them under the
    Pope's notice should have been Cardinal Contarini. Paul had no difficulty in
    recognizing the support which this new Order would bring to the Papacy in its
    conflict with Reformers, and its diplomatic embarrassments with Charles V. He is even
    reported to have said, 'The finger of God is there!' Yet he could not confirm the
    constitutions without the previous approval of three Cardinals appointed to report on
    them. This committee condemned Loyola's scheme; and nearly a year passed in
    negotiations with foreign princes and powerful prelates, before a reluctant consent
    was yielded to the Pope's avowed inclination. At length the Bull of Sept. 27, 1540,
    <i>Regimini militantis Ecclesiae</i>, launched the Society of Jesus on the world.
    Ignatius became the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248"
    id="page248"></a>{248}</span> General of the Order; and the rest of his life, a
    period of sixteen years, was spent in perfecting the machinery and extending the
    growth of this institution, which in all essentials was the emanation of his own
    mind.</p>
    <p>It may be well at this point to sketch the organization of the Jesuits, and to
    describe the progress of the Society during its founder's lifetime, in order that a
    correct conception may be gained of Loyola's share in its creation. Many historians
    of eminence, and among them so acute an observer as Paolo Sarpi, have been of the
    opinion that Jesuitry in its later developments was a deflection from the spirit and
    intention of Ignatius. It is affirmed that Lainez and Salmeron, rather than Loyola,
    gave that complexion to the Order which has rendered it a mark for the hatred and
    disgust of Europe. Aquaviva, the fifth General, has been credited with its policy of
    interference in affairs of states and nations. Yet I think it can be shown that the
    Society, as it appeared in the seventeenth century, was a logical and necessary
    development of the Society as Ignatius framed it in the sixteenth.<a
    name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160"
    class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>
    <p>Lainez, who succeeded the founder as General, digested the constitutions and
    supplied them <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>{249}</span>
    with a commentary or Directorium. He defined, formulated, and stereotyped the system;
    but the essential qualities of Jesuitry, its concentration upon political objects,
    its unscrupulousness in choice of means to ends, the worldliness which lurked beneath
    the famous motto <i>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</i>, were implicit in Loyola's express
    words, and in his actual administration. The framework of the Order, as he fixed it,
    was so firmly traced, and so cunningly devised for practical efficiency, that it
    admitted of no alteration except in the direction of more rigid definition. Lainez
    may, indeed, have emphasized its tendency to become a political machine, and may have
    weakened its religious tone, by his rules for the interpretation of the
    constitutions; but we have seen that the development of Loyola's own ideas ran in
    this direction. The real strength, as well as the worst vices of Jesuitry, were
    inherent in the system from the first; and in it we have perhaps the most remarkable
    instance on record, of the evolution of a cosmopolitan and world-important organism
    from the embryo of one man's conception.</p>
    <p>The Bull <i>Regimini militantis Ecclesiae</i> restricted the number of the Jesuits
    to sixty. If Ignatius did not himself propose this limit, the restriction may perhaps
    have suggested his policy of reserving the full privileges of the Society for a small
    band of selected members&mdash;the very essence of the body, extracted by processes
    which will be afterwards <span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"
    id="page250"></a>{250}</span> described. Anyhow, it is certain that though the Papal
    limitation was removed in 1543, and though candidates flowed on the tide of fashion
    toward the Order, yet the representative and responsible Fathers remained few in
    numbers. These were distributed as the General thought fit. He stayed in Rome; for
    Rome was the chosen headquarters of the Society, the nucleus of their growth, and the
    fulcrum of their energy. From Rome, as from a center, Ignatius moved his men about
    the field of Europe. We might compare him under one metaphor to a chess-player
    directing his pieces upon the squares of the political and ecclesiastical chessboard;
    under another, to a spider spinning his web so as to net the greatest number of
    profitable partisans. The fathers were kept in perpetual motion. To shift them from
    place to place, to exclude them from their native soil, to render them cosmopolitan
    and pliant was the first care of the founder. He forbade the follies of ascetic
    piety, inculcated the study of languages and exact knowledge, and above all things
    recommended the acquisition of those social arts which find favor with princes and
    folk of high condition. 'Prudence of an exquisite quality,' he said, 'combined with
    average sanctity, is more valuable than eminent sanctity and less of prudence.' Also
    he bade them keep their eyes open for neophytes 'less marked by pure goodness than by
    firmness of character and ability in conduct of affairs, since men who are not apt
    for public business do not suit the requirements <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> of the Company.' Orlandino tells us that
    though Ignatius felt drawn to men who showed eminent gifts for erudition, he
    preferred, in the difficulties of the Church, to choose such as knew the world well
    and were distinguished by their social station. The fathers were to seek out youths
    'of good natural parts, adapted to the acquisition of knowledge and to practical
    works of utility.' Their pupils were, if possible, to have physical advantages and
    manners that should render them agreeable. These points had more of practical value
    than a bare vocation for piety. In their dealings with tender consciences, they were
    to act like 'good fishers of souls, passing over many things in silence as though
    these had not been observed, until the time came when the will was gained, and the
    character could be directed as they thought best.'<a name="FNanchor_161_161"
    id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
    Loyola's dislike for the common forms of monasticism appears in his choice of the
    ordinary secular priest's cassock for their dress, and in his emancipation of the
    members from devotional exercises and attendance in the choir. The aversion he felt
    for ascetic discipline is evinced in a letter he addressed to Francis Borgia in 1548.
    It is better, he writes, to strengthen your stomach and other faculties, than to
    impair the body and enfeeble the intellect by fasting. God needs both our physical
    and mental powers for his service; and every drop of blood you shed in flagellation
    is a loss.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span></p>
    <p>The end in view was to serve the Church by penetrating European society, taking
    possession of its leaders in rank and hereditary influence, directing education,
    assuming the control of the confessional, and preaching the faith in forms adapted to
    the foibles and the fancies of the age. The interests of the Church were paramount:
    'If she teaches that what seems to us white is black, we must declare it to be black
    upon the spot.' There were other precepts added. These, for instance, seem worth
    commemoration: 'The workers in the Lord's vineyard should have but one foot on earth,
    the other should be raised to travel forward.' 'The abnegation of our own will is of
    more value than if one should bring the dead to life again.' 'No storm is so
    pernicious as a calm, and no enemy is so dangerous as having none.' It will be seen
    that what is known as Jesuitry, in its mundane force and in its personal devotion to
    a cause, emerges from the precepts of Ignatius. We may wonder how the romances of the
    mountain-keep of Loyola, the mysticism of Montserrat, and the struggles of Manresa
    should have brought the founder of the Jesuits to these results. Yet, if we analyze
    the problem, it will yield a probable solution. What survived from that first period
    was the spirit of enthusiastic service to the Church, the vast ambition of a man who
    felt himself a destined instrument for shoring up the crumbling walls of Catholicity,
    the martial instinct of a warrior fighting at fearful odds with nations running
    toward infidelity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"
    id="page253"></a>{253}</span></p>
    <p>He had no doubt where the right lay. He was a Spaniard, a servant of S. Peter; and
    for him the creed enounced by Rome was all in all. But his commerce with the world,
    his astute Basque nature, and his judgment of the European situation, taught him that
    he must use other means than those which Francis and Dominic had employed. He had to
    make his Company, that forlorn hope of Catholicism, the exponent of a decadent and
    rotten faith. He had to adapt it to the necessities of Christendom in dissolution, to
    constitute it by a guileful and sagacious method. He had to render it wise in the
    wisdom of the world, in order that he might catch the powers of this world by their
    interests and vices for the Church. He was like Machiavelli, endeavoring to save a
    corrupt state by utilizing corruption for ends acknowledged sound. And, like
    Machiavelli, he was mistaken, because it will not profit man to trust in craft or the
    manipulation of evil. Luther was stronger in his weakness than the creator of the
    Jesuit machinery, wiser in his simplicity than the deviser of that subtle engine. But
    Luther had the onward forces of humanity upon his side. Ignatius could but retard
    them by his ingenuity. We may be therefore excused if we admire Ignatius for the
    virile effort which he made in a failing cause, and for the splendid gifts of
    organizing prudence which he devoted to a misplaced object.</p>
    <p>Under his direction, the members of the Society <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page254" id="page254"></a>{254}</span> spread themselves over Europe, and
    always with similar results. Wherever they went, hundreds of adherents joined the
    Order. Paul III. and Julius III. heaped privileges upon it, seeing what a power it
    had become in warfare with heresy. Ignatius spared no pains to secure his position in
    Rome, paying court to Cardinals and prelates, visiting ambassadors and princes,
    soliciting their favors and offering the service of his brethren in return.
    Profitable negotiations were opened with the King of Spain and the Duke of Bavaria,
    which, under cover of reforming convents, led to a partition of ecclesiastical
    property between the Jesuits and the State. Good reasons seemed to justify such acts
    of spoliation; for the old orders were sunk in sloth and immorality beyond
    redemption, while the Company kept alive all that was sound in Catholic discipline,
    preaching, and instruction. In Italy the Jesuits made rapid progress from the first.
    Lainez occupied the Venetian territory, opposing Protestant opinions in Venice
    itself, at Brescia, and among the mountains of the Valtelline. Le Jay combated the
    forces of Calvin and Ren&eacute;e of France at Ferrara. Salmeron took possession of
    Naples and Sicily. Piacenza, Modena, Faenza, Bologna, and Montepulciano received the
    fathers with open arms. The Farnesi welcomed them in Parma. Wherever they went, they
    secured the good will of noble women, and gained some hold on universities. Colleges
    were founded in the chief cities of the peninsula, where <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page255" id="page255"></a>{255}</span> they not only taught gratis, but used
    methods superior to those previously in vogue. Rome, however, remained the stronghold
    of the Company. Here Ignatius founded its first house in 1550. This was the Collegium
    Romanum; and in 1555, some hundred pupils, who had followed a course of studies in
    Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and theology, issued from its walls. In 1557 he purchased the
    palace Salviati, on the site of which now stands the vast establishment of the
    Ges&ugrave;. In 1552 he started a separate institution, Collegium Germanicum, for the
    special training of young Germans. There was also a subordinate institution for the
    education of the sons of nobles. These colleges afforded models for similar schools
    throughout Europe; some of them intended to supply the society with members, and some
    to impress the laity with Catholic principles. Uniformity was an object which the
    Jesuits always held in view.</p>
    <p>They did not meet at first with like success in all Catholic countries. In Spain,
    Charles V. treated them with suspicion as the sworn men of the Papacy; and the
    Dominican order, so powerful through its hold upon the Inquisition, regarded them
    justly as rivals. Though working for the same end, the means employed by Jesuits and
    Dominicans were too diverse for these champions of orthodoxy to work harmoniously
    together. The Jesuits belonged to the future, to the party of accommodation and
    control by subterfuge. The Dominicans were rooted in the past; their dogmatism
    admitted of no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>{256}</span>
    compromise; they strove to rule by force. There was therefore, at the outset, war
    between the kennels of the elder and the younger dogs of God in Spain. Yet Jesuitism
    gained ground. It had the advantage of being a native, and a recent product. It was
    powerful by its appeals to the sensuous imagination and carnal superstitions of that
    Iberian-Latin people. It was seductive by its mitigation of oppressive orthodoxy and
    inflexible prescriptive law. Where the Dominican was steel, the Jesuit was reed;
    where the Dominican breathed fire and fagots, the Jesuit suggested casuistical
    distinctions; where the Dominican raised difficulties, the Jesuit solved scruples;
    where the Dominican presented theological abstractions, the Jesuit offered
    stimulative or agreeable images; where the Dominican preached dogma, the Jesuit
    retailed romance. It only needed one illustrious convert to plant the Jesuits in
    Spain. Him they found in Francis Borgia, Duke of Gandia, Viceroy of Catalonia, and
    subsequently the third General of the Order and a saint. This man placed the
    university, which he had founded, in their hands; and about the same time they gained
    a footing in the university of Salamanca. Still they continued to retain their
    strongest hold upon the people, who regarded them as saviours from the tyranny and
    ennui of the established Dominican hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Portugal was won at a blow. Xavier and Rodriguez planted the Company there under
    the affectionate protection of King John III. When<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page257" id="page257"></a>{257}</span> Xavier started on his mission to the
    Indies in 1541, Rodriguez took the affairs of the realm into his hands, controlled
    the cabinet, and formed the heir-apparent to their will.</p>
    <p>With France they had more trouble. Both the University and the Parliament of Paris
    opposed their settlement. The Sorbonne even declared them 'dangerous in matters of
    the faith, fit to disturb the peace of the Church, and to reverse the order of
    monastic life; more adapted to destroy than to build.' The Gallican Church scented
    danger in these bondsmen of the Papacy; and it was only when they helped to organize
    the League that the influence of the Guises gave them a foothold in the kingdom. Even
    then their seminaries at Reims, Douai, and S. Omer must be rather regarded as
    outposts <i>epiteichismoi</i> against England and Flanders, than, as nationally
    French establishments. In France they long remained a seditious and belligerent
    faction.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>
    <p>They had the same partial and clandestine success in the Low Countries, where
    their position was at first equivocal, though they early gained some practical hold
    upon the University of Louvain. We are perhaps justified in attributing the evil fame
    of Reims, Douai, S. Omer, and Louvain to the incomplete sympathy which existed
    between the Jesuits and the countries where they made these settlements. Not
    perfectly at home, surrounded by discontent <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"
    id="page258"></a>{258}</span> and jealousy, upon the borderlands of the heresies they
    were bound to combat, their system assumed its darkest colors in those hotbeds of
    intrigue and feverish fanaticism. In time, however, the Jesuits fixed their talons
    firmly upon the Netherlands, through the favor of Anne of Austria; and the year 1562
    saw them comfortably ensconced at Antwerp, Louvain, Brussels, and Lille, in spite of
    the previous antipathy of the population. Here, as elsewhere, they pushed their way
    by gaining women and people of birth to their cause, and by showily meritorious
    services to education. Faber achieved ephemeral success as lecturer at Louvain.</p>
    <p>To take firm hold on Germany had been the cherished wish of Ignatius; 'for there,'
    to use his own words, 'the pest of heresy exposed men to graver dangers than
    elsewhere.' The Society had scarcely been founded when Faber, Le Jay, and Bobadilla
    were sent north. Faber made small progress, and was removed to Spain. But Bobadilla
    secured the confidence of William, Duke of Bavaria; while Le Jay won that of
    Ferdinand of Austria. In both provinces they avowed their intention of working at the
    reformation of the clergy and the improvement of popular education&mdash;ends, which
    in the disorganized condition of Germany, seemed of highest importance to those
    princes. Through the influence of Bavaria, Bobadilla succeeded in rendering the
    Interim proclaimed by Charles V. nugatory; while Le Jay founded the college of the
    Order at<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span> Vienna.
    In this important post he was soon succeeded by Canisius, Ferdinand's confessor,
    through whose co-operation Cardinal Morone afterwards brought this Emperor into
    harmony with the Papal plan for winding up the Council of Trent. It should be added
    that Ingolstadt, in Bavaria, became the second headquarters of the Jesuit propaganda
    in Germany.</p>
    <p>The methods adopted by Ignatius in dealing with his three lieutenants, Bobadilla,
    Le Jay, and Canisius, are so characteristic of Jesuit policy that they demand
    particular attention. Checkmated by Bobadilla in the matter of the Interim, Charles
    V. manifested his resentment. He was already ill-affected toward the Society, and its
    founder felt the need of humoring him. The highest grade of the Order was therefore
    ostentatiously refused to Bobadilla, until such time as the Emperor's attention was
    distracted from the cause of his disappointment. With Le Jay and Canisius the case
    stood differently. Ferdinand wished to make the former Bishop of Triest and the
    latter Archbishop of Vienna. Ignatius opposed both projects, alleging that the
    Company of Jesus could not afford to part with its best servants, and that their vows
    of obedience and poverty were inconsistent with high office in the Church. He
    discerned the necessity of reducing each member of the Society to absolute dependence
    on the General, which would have been impracticable if any one of them attained to
    the position of a pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"
    id="page260"></a>{260}</span> late. A law was therefore passed declaring it mortal
    sin for Jesuits to accept bishoprics or other posts of honor in the Church. Instead
    of assuming the miter, Canisius was permitted to administer the See of Vienna without
    usufruct of its revenues. To the world this manifested the disinterested zeal of the
    Jesuits in a seductive light; while the integrity of the Society, as an independent
    self-sufficing body, exacting the servitude of absolute devotion from its members,
    was secured. Another instance of the same adroitness may be mentioned. The Emperor in
    1552 offered a Cardinal's hat to Francis Borgia, who was by birth the most
    illustrious of living Jesuits. Ignatius refrained from rebuffing the Emperor and
    insulting the Duke of Gandia by an open prohibition; but he told the former to expect
    the Duke's refusal, while he wrote to the latter expressing his own earnest hope that
    he would renounce an honor injurious to the Society. This diplomacy elicited a
    grateful but firm answer of <i>Nolo Episcopari</i> from the Duke, who thus took the
    responsibility of offending Charles V. upon himself. Meanwhile the missionary objects
    of the Company were not neglected. Xavier left Portugal in 1541 for that famous
    journey through India and China, the facts of which may be compared for their
    romantic interest with Cortes' or Pizarro's exploits. Brazil, the transatlantic
    Portugal, was abandoned to the Jesuits, and they began to feel their way in Mexico.
    In the year of Loyola's death, 1561, thirty-two <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page261" id="page261"></a>{261}</span> members of the Society were resident in
    South America; one hundred in India, China, and Japan; and a mission was established
    in Ethiopia. Even Ireland had been explored by a couple of fathers, who returned
    without success, after undergoing terrible hardships. At this epoch the Society
    counted in round numbers one thousand men. It was divided in Europe into thirteen
    provinces: seven of these were Portuguese and Spanish; three were Italian, namely,
    Rome, Upper Italy, and Sicily; one was French; two were German. Castile contained ten
    colleges of the Order; Aragon, five; Andalusia, five. Portugal was penetrated through
    and through with Jesuits. Rome displayed the central Roman and Teutonic colleges.
    Upper Italy had ten colleges. France could show only one college. In Upper Germany
    the Company held firm hold on Vienna, Prag, Munich, and Ingolstadt. The province of
    Lower Germany, including the Netherlands, was still undetermined. This expansion of
    the Order during the first sixteen years of its existence, enables us to form some
    conception of the intellectual vigor and commanding will of Ignatius. He lived, as no
    founder of an order, as few founders of religions, ever lived, to see his work
    accomplished, and the impress of his genius stereotyped exactly in the forms he had
    designed, upon the most formidable social and political organization of modern
    Europe.</p>
    <p>In his administration of the Order, Ignatius was absolute and autocratic. We have
    seen how he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>{262}</span>
    dealt with aspirants after ecclesiastical honors, and how he shifted his
    subordinates, as he thought best, from point to point upon the surface of the globe.
    The least attempt at independence on the part of his most trusted lieutenants was
    summarily checked by him. Simon Rodriguez, one of the earliest disciples of the
    College of S. Barbe at Paris, ruled the kingdom of Portugal through the ascendency
    which he had gained over John III. Elated by the vastness of his victory, Rodriguez
    arrogated to himself the right of private judgment, and introduced that ascetic
    discipline into the houses of his province which Ignatius had forbidden as
    inexpedient. Without loss of time, the General superseded him in his command; and,
    after a sharp struggle, Rodriguez was compelled to spend the rest of his days under
    strict surveillance at Rome. Lainez, in like manner, while acting as Provincial of
    Upper Italy, thought fit to complain that his best coadjutors were drawn from the
    colleges under his control, to Rome. Ignatius wrote to this old friend, the man who
    best understood the spirit of its institution, and who was destined to succeed him in
    his headship, a cold and terrible epistle. 'Reflect upon your conduct. Let me know
    whether you acknowledge your sin, and tell me at the same time what punishment you
    are ready to undergo for this dereliction of duty.' Lainez expressed immediate
    submission in the most abject terms; he was ready to resign his post, abstain from
    preaching, confine his studies to the Breviary, walk <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page263" id="page263"></a>{263}</span> as a beggar to Rome, and there teach
    grammar to children, or perform menial offices. This was all Ignatius wanted. If he
    were the Christ of the Society, he well knew that Lainez was its S. Paul. He could
    not prevent him from being his successor, and he probably was well aware that Lainez
    would complete and supplement what he must leave unfinished in his life-work. The
    groveling apology of such an eminent apostle, dictated as it was by hypocrisy and
    cunning, sufficed to procure his pardon, and remained among the archives of the
    Jesuits as a model for the spirit in which obedience should be manifested by
    them.</p>
    <p>Obedience was, in fact, the cardinal and dominant quality of the Jesuit Order. To
    call it a virtue, in the sense in which Ignatius understood it, is impossible. The
    <i>Exercitia</i>, the Constitutions, and the Letter to the Portuguese Jesuits, all of
    which undoubtedly explain Loyola's views, reveal to us the essence of historical
    Jesuitry, the <i>fons et origo</i> of that long-continued evil which impested modern
    society. Let us examine some of his precepts on this topic. 'I ought to desire to be
    ruled by a superior who endeavors to subjugate my judgment and subdue my
    understanding.'&mdash;'When it seems to me that I am commanded by my superior to do a
    thing against which my conscience revolts as sinful, and my superior judges
    otherwise, it is my duty to yield my doubts to him, unless I am constrained by
    evident reasons.'&mdash;'I ought not to be my own, but His who created <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span> me, and his too
    through whom God governs me.'&mdash;'I ought to be like a corpse, which has neither
    will nor understanding; like a crucifix, that is turned about by him that holds it;
    like a staff in the hands of an old man, who uses it at will for his assistance or
    pleasure.'&mdash;'In our Company the person who commands must never be regarded in
    his own capacity, but as Jesus Christ in him.'&mdash;'I desire that you strive and
    exercise yourselves to recognize Christ our Lord in every Superior.'&mdash;'He who
    wishes to offer himself wholly up to God, must make the sacrifice not only of his
    will but of his intelligence.'&mdash;'In order to secure the faithful and successful
    execution of a Superior's orders, all private judgment must be yielded up.'&mdash;'A
    sin, whether venial or mortal, must be committed, if it is commanded by the Superior
    in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, or in virtue of obedience.' Of such nature was
    the virtue of obedience within the Order.<a name="FNanchor_163_163"
    id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It
    rendered every member a tool in the hands of his immediate Superior, and the whole
    body one instrument in the hand of the General. The General's responsibility for the
    oblique acts and evasions of moral law, committed in the name of this virtue, was
    covered by the sounding phrase, 'Unto the greater glory of God.'<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page265" id="page265"></a>{265}</span></p>
    <p>He had also his own duty of obedience, which was to Holy Church. 'In making the
    sacrifice of our own judgment, the mind must keep itself ever whole and ready for
    obedience to the spouse of Christ, our Holy Mother, the Church orthodox, apostolical
    and hierarchical.'<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Not a portion of the Catholic
    creed, of Catholic habits, of Catholic institutions, of Catholic superstitions, but
    must be valiantly defended.&mdash;'It is our duty loudly to uphold reliques, the cult
    of saints, stations, pilgrimages indulgences, jubilees, the candles which are lighted
    before altars.' To criticise the clergy, even though notoriously corrupt, is a sin.
    The philosophy of the Church, as expressed by S. Thomas Aquinas, S. Bonaventura, and
    others, must be recognized as equal in authority with Holy Writ. It follows that just
    as a subordinate was enjoined to sin, if sin were ordered by his Superior, so the
    whole Company were bound to lie, and do the things they disapproved, and preach the
    mummeries in which they disbelieved, in virtue of obedience to the Church. They may
    not even trust their senses; for 'If the Church pronounces a thing which seems to us
    white to be black, we must immediately say that it is black.'<a

    <p>The Jesuits were enrolled as an army, in an hour of grave peril for the Church, to
    undertake her defense. They pledged themselves, by this vow of obedience, to perform
    that duty with their eyes shut. It was not their mission to reform or purify or
    revivify Catholicism, but to maintain it intact with all its intellectual
    anachronisms. How well they succeeded may be judged from the issue of the Council of
    Trent, in which Lainez and Salmeron played so prominent a part. That rigid
    enforcement of every jot and tittle in the Catholic hierarchical organization, in
    Catholic ritual, in the Catholic cult of saints and images, in the Catholic
    interpretation of Sacraments, in Catholic tradition as of equal value with the Bible,
    and lastly in the theory of Papal Supremacy, which was the astounding result of a
    Council convened to alter and reform the Church, can be attributed in no small
    measure to Jesuit persistency.</p>
    <p>Ignatius attained his object. Obedience, blind, servile, unquestioning,
    unscrupulous, became the distinguishing feature of the Jesuits. But he condemned his
    Order to mediocrity. No really great man in any department of human knowledge or
    activity has arisen in the Company of Jesus. In course of time it became obvious to
    any one of independent character and original intellect that their ranks were not the
    place for him. And if youths of real eminence entered it before they perceived this
    truth, their spirit was crushed. The machine was powerful enough for good and evil;
    but it remained an aggregate of individual inferiorities. Its merit and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> its perfection lay in
    this, that so complex an instrument could be moved by a single finger of the General
    in Rome. He consistently employed its delicate system of wheels and pulleys for the
    aggrandizement of the Order in the first place, in the second place for the control
    of the Catholic Church, and always for the subjugation and cretinization of the mind
    of Europe.</p>
    <p>The training of a Jesuit began with study of the <i>Exercitia Spiritualia</i>.<a
    name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166"
    class="fnanchor">[166]</a> This manual had been composed by Loyola himself at
    intervals between 1522 and 1548, when it received the imprimatur of Pope Paul III. He
    based it on his own experiences at Manresa, and meant it to serve as a perpetual
    introduction to the mysteries of the religious life. It was used under the direction
    of a father, who prescribed a portion of its text for each day's meditation,
    employing various means to concentrate attention and enforce effect. The whole course
    of this spiritual drill extended over four weeks, during which the pupil remained in
    solitude. Light and sound and all distractions of the outer world were carefully
    excluded from his chamber. He was bidden to direct his soul inward upon itself and
    God, and was led by graduated stages to realize in the most vivid way the torments of
    the damned and the scheme of man's, salvation. The first week was occupied in an
    examination of the conscience; the second in contempla<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page268" id="page268"></a>{268}</span> tion of Christ's Kingdom upon earth; the
    third in meditation on the Passion; the fourth in an ascent to the glory of the risen
    Lord. Materialism of the crudest type mingled with the indulgence of a reverie in
    this long spiritual journey. At every step the neophyte employed his five senses in
    the effort of intellectual realization. Prostrate upon the ground, gazing with closed
    eyelids in the twilight of his cell upon the mirror of imagination, he had to
    <i>see</i> the boundless flames of hell and souls encased in burning bodies, to
    <i>hear</i> the shrieks and blasphemies, to <i>smell</i> their sulphur and
    intolerable stench, to <i>taste</i> the bitterness of tears and <i>feel</i> the
    stings of ineffectual remorse.</p>
    <p>He had to localize each object in the camera obscura of the brain. If the Garden
    of Gethsemane, for instance, were the subject of his meditation, he was bound to
    place Christ here and the sleeping apostles there, and to form an accurate image of
    the angel and the cup. He gazed and gazed, until he was able to handle the raiment of
    the Saviour, to watch the drops of bloody sweat beading his forehead and trickling
    down his cheeks, to grasp the chalice with the fingers of the soul. As each carefully
    chosen and sagaciously suggested scene was presented, he had to identify his very
    being, soul, will, intellect, and senses, with the mental vision. He lived again, so
    far as this was possible through fancy, the facts of sacred history. If the director
    judged it advisable, symbolic objects were placed before him in the cell; at one time
    skulls and bones, at another fresh sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"
    id="page269"></a>{269}</span> smelling flowers. Fasting and flagellation, peculiar
    postures of the body, groanings and weepings, were prescribed as mechanical aids in
    cases where the soul seemed sluggish. The sphere traversed in these exercises was a
    narrow one. The drill aimed at intensity of discipline, at a concentrated and
    concrete impression, not at width of education or at intellectual enlightenment.
    Speculation upon the fundamental principles of religion was excluded. God's dealings
    with mankind revealed in the Old Testament found no place in this theory of
    salvation. Attention was riveted upon a very few points in the life of Christ and
    Mary, such as every Catholic child might be supposed to be familiar with. But it was
    fixed in such a way as to bring the terrors and raptures of the mystics, of a S.
    Catharine or a S. Teresa, within the reach of all; to place spiritual experience
    <i>&agrave; la port&eacute;e de tout le monde</i>. The vulgarity is only equaled by
    the ingenuity and psychological adroitness of the method. The soul inspired with
    carnal dread of the doom impending over it, passed into almost physical contact with
    the incarnate Saviour. The designed effect was to induce a vivid and varied hypnotic
    dream of thirty days, from the influence of which a man should never wholly free
    himself. The end at which he arrived upon this path of self-scrutiny and
    materialistic realization, was the conclusion that his highest hope, his most
    imperative duty, lay in the resignation of his intellect and will to spiritual
    guidance, and in blind obedience to the Church. Thou<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> sands and thousands of souls in the
    modern world have passed through this discipline; and those who responded to it best,
    have ever been selected, when this was possible, as novices of the Order. The
    director had ample opportunity of observing at each turn in the process whether his
    neophyte displayed a likely disposition.</p>
    <p>When the <i>Exercitia</i> had been performed, there was an end of asceticism.
    Ignatius, as we have seen, dreaded nothing more than the intrusion of that dark
    spirit into his Company; he aimed at nothing more earnestly than at securing
    agreeable manners, a cheerful temper, and ability for worldly business in its
    members.</p>
    <p>The novice, when first received into one of the Jesuit houses, was separated, so
    far as possible, for two years from his family, and placed under the control of a
    master, who inspected his correspondence and undertook the full surveillance of his
    life. He received cautiously restricted information on the constitutions of the
    Society, and was recommended, instead of renouncing his worldly possessions, to
    reserve his legal rights and make oblation of them when he took the vows. It was not
    then made clear to him that what he gave would never under any circumstances be
    restored, although the Society might send him forth at will a penniless wanderer into
    the world. Yet this was the hard condition of a Jesuit's existence. After entering
    the order, he owned nothing, and he had no power to depart if he repented. But <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>{271}</span> the General could
    cashier him by a stroke of the pen, condemning him to destitution in every land where
    Jesuits held sway, and to suspicion in every land where Jesuits were loathed. Before
    the end of two years, the novice generally signed an obligation to assume the vows.
    He was then drafted into the secular or spiritual service. Some novices became what
    is called Temporal Coadjutors; their duty was to administer the property of the
    Society, to superintend its houses, to distribute alms, to work in hospitals, to
    cook, garden, wash, and act as porters. They took the three vows of poverty,
    chastity, and obedience. Those, on the other hand, who showed some aptitude for
    learning, were classified as Scholastics, and were distributed among the colleges of
    the order. They studied languages, sciences, and theology, for a period of five
    years; after which they taught in schools for another period of five or six years;
    and when they reached the age of about thirty, they might be ordained priests with
    the title of Spiritual Coadjutors. From this body the Society drew the rectors and
    professors of its colleges, its preachers, confessors, and teachers in schools for
    the laity. They were not yet full members, though they had taken the three vows, and
    were irrevocably devoted to the service of the order. The final stage of initiation
    was reached toward the age of forty-five, after long and various trials. Then the
    Jesuit received the title of Professed. He was either a professed of the three vows,
    or a professed of the four vows; having in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"
    id="page272"></a>{272}</span> the latter case dedicated his life to the special
    service of the Papacy, in missions or in any other cause. The professed of four vows
    constituted the veritable Company of Jesus, the kernel of the organization. They were
    never numerous. At Loyola's death they numbered thirty-five out of a thousand; and it
    has been calculated that their average proportion to the whole body is as two to a
    hundred.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Even these had no indefeasible
    tenure of their place in the Society. They might be dismissed by the General without
    indemnification.</p>
    <p>The General was chosen for life from the professed of four vows by the General
    Congregation, which consisted of the provincials and two members of each province. He
    held the whole Society at his discretion; for he could deal at pleasure with each
    part of its machinery. The constitutions, strict as they appeared, imposed no
    barriers upon his will; for almost unlimited power was surrendered to him of
    dispensing with formalities, freeing from obligations, shortening or lengthening the
    periods of initiation, retarding or advancing a member in his career. Ideal fixity of
    type, qualified by the utmost elasticity in practice, formed the essence of the
    system. And we shall see that this principle pervaded the Jesuit treatment of
    morality. The General resided at Rome, consecrated solely to the government of the
    Society, holding the threads of all its complicated affairs in his hands, studying
    the per<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>{273}</span> sonal
    history of each of its members in the minute reports which he constantly received
    from every province, and acting precisely as he chose with the highest as well as the
    lowest of his subordinates. Contrary to all precedents of previous religious orders,
    Ignatius framed the Company of Jesus upon the lines of a close aristocracy with
    autocratic authority confided to an elected chief. Yet the General of the Jesuits,
    like the Doge of Venice, had his hands tied by subtly powerful though almost
    invisible fetters. He was subjected at every hour of the day and night to the
    surveillance of five sworn spies, especially appointed to prevent him from altering
    the type or neglecting the concerns of the Order. The first of these functionaries,
    named the Administrator, who was frequently also the confessor of the General,
    exhorted him to obedience, and reminded him that he must do all things for the glory
    of God. Obedience and the glory of God, in Jesuit phraseology, meant the maintenance
    of the Company. The other four were styled Assistants. They had under their charge
    the affairs of the chief provinces; one overseeing the Indies, another Portugal and
    Spain, a third France and Germany, a fourth Italy and Sicily. Together with the
    Administrator, the Assistants were nominated by the General Congregation and could
    not be removed or replaced without its sanction. It was their duty to regulate the
    daily life of the General, to control his private expenditure on the scale which they
    determined, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>{274}</span>
    prescribe what he should eat and drink, and to appoint his hours for sleep, and
    religious exercises, and the transaction of public business. If they saw grave
    reasons for his deposition, they were bound to convene the General Congregation for
    that purpose. And since the Founder knew that guardians need to be guarded, he
    provided that the Provincials might convene this assembly to call in question the
    acts of the Assistants. The General himself had no power to oppose its
    convocation.</p>
    <p>The Company of Jesus was thus based upon a system of mutual and pervasive
    espionage. The novice on first entering had all his acts, habits, and personal
    qualities registered. As he advanced in his career, he was surrounded by jealous
    brethren, who felt it their duty to report his slightest weakness to a superior. The
    superiors were watched by one another and by their inferiors. Masses of secret
    intelligence poured into the central cabinet of the General; and the General himself
    ate, slept, prayed, worked, and moved about the world beneath the fixed gaze of ten
    vigilant eyes. Men accustomed to domesticity and freedom may wonder that life should
    have been tolerable upon these terms. Yet we must remember that from the moment when
    a youth had undergone the <i>Exercitia</i> and taken the vows, he became no less in
    fact than in spirit <i>perinde ac cadaver</i> in the hands of his superior. The
    Company replaced for him both family and state; and in spite of the fourth vow, it is
    very evident <span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span>
    that the Black Pope, as the General came to be nicknamed, owned more of his
    allegiance than the White Pope, who filled the chair of S. Peter. He could, indeed,
    at any moment be expelled and ruined. But if he served the Order well, he belonged to
    a vast incalculably-potent organism, of which he might naturally, after such training
    as he had received, be proud. The sacrifice of his personal volition and intelligence
    made him part of an indestructible corporation, which seemed capable of breaking all
    resistance by its continuity of will and effecting all purposes by its condensed
    sagacity. Nor was he in the hands of rigid disciplinarians. His peccadilloes were
    condoned, unless the credit of the order came in question. His natural abilities
    obtained free scope for their employment; for it suited the interest of the Company
    to make the most of each member's special gifts. He had no tedious duties of the
    regular monastic routine to follow. He was encouraged to become a man of the world,
    and to mix freely with society. And thus, while he resigned himself, he lived the
    large life of a complex microcosm. Nor were men of resolute ambition without the
    prospect of eventually swaying an authority beyond that possessed by princes; for any
    one of the professed might rise to the supreme power in the order.</p>
    <p>Something must be said about Loyola's interpretation of the vow of poverty. During
    his lifetime the Company acquired considerable wealth; <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page276" id="page276"></a>{276}</span> and after his death it became a large
    owner of estates in Europe. How was this consistent with the observance of that vow,
    so strictly inculcated by the founder on his first disciples, and so pompously
    proclaimed in their constitutions? The professed and all their houses, as well as
    their churches, were bound to subsist on alms; they preached, administered the
    sacraments of the Church, and educated gratis. They could inherit nothing, and were
    not allowed to receive money for their journeys. But here appeared the wisdom of
    restricting the numbers of the professed to a small percentage of the whole Society.
    The same rigid prohibition with regard to property was not imposed upon the houses of
    novices, colleges, and other educational establishments of the Jesuits; while the
    secular coadjutors were specially appointed for the administration of wealth which
    the professed might use but could not own.<a name="FNanchor_168_168"
    id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> In
    like manner, as they lived on alms, there was no objection to a priest of the order
    receiving valuable gifts in cash or kind from grateful recipients of his spiritual
    bounty. A separate article of the constitutions furthermore reserved for the General
    the right of accepting any donation whatsoever, made in favor of the whole Company,
    and of assigning capital or revenue as he judged wisest.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page277" id="page277"></a>{277}</span></p>
    <p>Scholastics, even after they had taken the vow of poverty, were not obliged to
    relinquish their private possessions. Sooner or later, it was hoped that these would
    become the property of the order. In a word, the principle of this solemn obligation
    was so manipulated as to facilitate the acquisition and accumulation of wealth by the
    Jesuit like any other corporation. Only no individual Jesuit owned anything. He was
    rich or poor, he wore the clothes of princes or the rags of a mendicant, he lived
    sumptuously or begged in the street, he traveled with a following of servants or he
    walked on foot, according as it seemed good to his superiors. The vow of poverty,
    thus interpreted in practice, meant a total disengagement from temporalities on the
    part of every member, an absolute dependence of each subordinate upon his superior in
    the hierarchy.</p>
    <p>Having thus far treated the organization of the Jesuits as implicit in Loyola's
    own conception and administration, I ought to add that it received definite form from
    his successor, Lainez. The founder pronounced the Constitutions in 1553. But they
    were thoroughly revised after his death in 1558, at which date they first issued from
    the press. Lainez, again, supplemented these laws with a perpetual commentary, which
    is styled the Declarations. These contain the bulk of those easements and indulgent
    interpretations, whereby the strictness of the original rules was explained away, and
    an almost unbounded elasticity was communicated to the system.</p>
    <p>It would be rash to pronounce a decided opinion <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page278" id="page278"></a>{278}</span> upon the much disputed question,
    whether, in addition to their Constitutions and Declarations, the Jesuits were
    provided with an esoteric code of rules known as <i>Monita Secreta</i>.<a
    name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169"
    class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The existence of such a manual, which was supposed to
    contain the very pith of Jesuitical policy, has been confidently asserted and no less
    confidently denied. In the absence of direct evidence, it may be worth quoting two
    passages from Sarpi's Letters, which prove that this keen-sighted observer believed
    the Society to be governed in its practice by statutes inaccessible to all but its
    most trusted members. 'I have always admired the policy of the Jesuits,' he writes in
    1608, 'and their method of maintaining secrecy. Their Constitutions are in print, and
    yet one cannot set eyes upon a copy. I do not mean their Rules, which are published
    at Lyons, for those are mere puerilities; but the digest of laws which guide their
    conduct of the order, and which they keep concealed. Every day many members leave, or
    are expelled from the Company; and yet their artifices are not exposed to view.'<a
    name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"
    class="fnanchor">[170]</a> In another letter, of the date 1610, Sarpi returns to the
    same point. 'The Jesuits before this Aquaviva was elected General were saints in
    comparison with what they afterwards became. Formerly they had not mixed in affairs
    of state or thought of governing cities. Since then, they have indulged a hope of
    controlling the whole world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"
    id="page279"></a>{279}</span></p>
    <p>And I am sure that the least part of their Cabala is in the Ordinances and
    Constitutions of 1570. All the same, I am very glad to possess even these. Their true
    Cabala they never communicate to any but men who have been well tested, and proved by
    every species of trial; nor is it possible for those who have been initiated into it,
    to think of retiring from the order, since the congregation, through their excellent
    management of its machinery, know how to procure the immediate death of any such
    initiated member who may wish to leave their ranks.'<a name="FNanchor_171_171"
    id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
    Probably the mistake which Sarpi and the world made, was in supposing that the
    Jesuits needed a written code for their most vital action. Being a potent and
    life-penetrated organism, the secret of their policy was not such as could be reduced
    to rule. It was not such as, if reduced to rule, could have been plastic in the
    affairs of public importance which the Company sought to control. Better than rule or
    statute, it was biological function. The supreme deliberative bodies of the order
    created, transmitted, and continuously modified its tradition of policy. This
    tradition some member, partially initiated into their counsels, may have reduced to
    precepts in the published <i>Monita Secreta</i> of 1612. But the quintessential flame
    which breathed a breath of life into the fabric of the Jesuits through two centuries
    of organic activity, was far too vivid and too spiritual to be condensed in any
    charter. A friar and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"
    id="page280"></a>{280}</span> jurist, like Sarpi, expected to discover some
    controlling code. The public, grossly ignorant of evolutionary laws in the formation
    of social organisms, could not comprehend the non-existence of this code. Adventurers
    supplied the demand from their knowledge of the ruling policy. But like the <i>Liber
    Trium Impostorum</i> we may regard the <i>Monita Secreta</i> of the Jesuits as an
    <i>ex post facto</i> fabrication.</p>
    <p>There is no need to trace the further history of the Jesuits. Their part in the
    Counter-Reformation has rather been exaggerated than insufficiently recognized.
    Though it was incontestably considerable, we cannot now concede, as Macaulay in his
    random way conceded to this Company, the <i>spolia opima</i> of down-beaten
    Protestantism. Without the ecclesiastical reform which originated in the Tridentine
    Council; without the gold and sword of Spain; without the stakes and prisons of the
    Inquisition; without the warfare against thought conducted by the Congregation of the
    Index; the Jesuits alone could not have masterfully governed the Catholic revival.
    That revival was a movement of world-historical importance, in which they
    participated. It was their fortune to find forces in the world which they partially
    understood; it was their merit to know how to manipulate those forces; it was their
    misfortune and their demerit that they proved themselves incapable of diverting those
    forces to any wholesome end. In Italy a succession of worldly Popes, Paul III.,
    Julius III., Pius IV., and Gregory XIII., <span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"
    id="page281"></a>{281}</span> heaped favors and showered wealth upon the order. The
    Jesuits incarnated the political spirit of the Papacy at this epoch; they lent it a
    potency for good and evil which the decrepit but still vigorous institution arrogated
    to itself. They adapted its anachronisms with singular adroitness to the needs of
    modern society. They transfused their throbbing blood into its flaccid veins, until
    it became doubtful whether the Papacy had been absorbed into the Jesuits, or whether
    the Jesuits had remodeled the Papacy for contemporary uses. But this tendency in the
    aspiring order to identify itself with Rome, this ambition to command the prestige of
    Rome as leverage for carrying out its own designs, stirred the resentment of haughty
    and <i>intransigeant</i> Pontiffs. The Jesuits were not beloved by Paul IV., Pius V.,
    and Sixtus V.</p>
    <p>It remains, however, to inquire in what the originality, the effective operation,
    and the modifying influence of the Jesuit Society consisted during the period with
    which we are concerned. It was their object to gain control over Europe by preaching,
    education, the direction of souls, and the management of public affairs. In each of
    these departments their immediate success was startling; for they labored with zeal,
    and they adapted their methods to the requirements of the age. Yet, in the long run,
    art, science, literature, religion, morality and politics, all suffered from their
    interference. By preferring artifice to reality, affectation to sincerity, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>{282}</span> shams and subterfuges
    to plain principle and candor, they confused the conscience and enfeebled the
    intellect of Catholic Europe. When we speak of the Jesuit style in architecture,
    rhetoric and poetry, of Jesuit learning and scholarship, of Jesuit casuistry and of
    Jesuit diplomacy, it is either with languid contempt for bad taste and insipidity, or
    with the burning indignation which systematic falsehood and corruption inspire in
    honorable minds.</p>
    <p>In education, the Jesuits, if they did not precisely innovate, improved upon the
    methods of the grammarians which had persisted from the Middle Ages through the
    Renaissance. They spared no pains in training a large and competent body of
    professors, men of extensive culture, formed upon one uniform pattern, and exercised
    in the art of popularizing knowledge. These teachers were distributed over the Jesuit
    colleges; and in every country their system was the same. New catechisms, grammars,
    primers, manuals of history, enabled their pupils to learn with facility in a few
    months what it had cost years of painful labor to acquire under pompous pedants of
    the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>. The mental and physical aptitudes of youths committed
    to their charge were carefully observed; and classes were adapted to various ages and
    degrees of capacity. Hours of recreation alternated with hours of study, so that the
    effort of learning should be neither irksome nor injurious to health. Nor was
    religious education neglected. Attendance upon daily Mass, monthly <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>{283}</span> confession, and
    instruction in the articles of the faith, formed an indispensable part of the system.
    When we remember that these advantages were offered gratuitously to the public, it is
    not surprising that people of all ranks and conditions should have sent their boys to
    the Jesuit colleges. Even Protestants availed themselves of what appeared so
    excellent a method; and the Jesuits obtained the reputation of being the best
    instructors of youth.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> It soon became the mark of a good
    Catholic to have frequented Jesuit schools; and in after life a pupil who had studied
    creditably in their colleges, found himself everywhere at home. Yet the Society took
    but little interest in elementary or popular education. Their object was to gain
    possession of the nobility, gentry, and upper middle class. The proletariat might
    remain ignorant; it was the destiny of such folk to be passive instruments in the
    hands of spiritual and temporal rulers. Nor were they always scrupulous in the means
    employed for taking hold on young men of distinction. One instance of the animosity
    they aroused, even in Italy, at an early period of their activity, will suffice.
    Tuscany was thrown into commotion by the discovery of their designs upon the boys
    they undertook to teach.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>{284}</span> 'They were
    so madly bent,' says Galluzzi, 'upon filling the ranks of their Company with
    individuals of wealth and birth, that in 1584, in the single city of Siena, under the
    pretense of devotion, they seduced thirty youths of the noblest and richest houses,
    not without great injury to their families and grief to their parents. The most
    notorious of these cases Was that of two sons of Pandolfo Petrucci, whose name
    indicates his high position in the aristocracy of Siena. These young men they got
    into their power by inducing them to commit a theft, and then compelled them to
    pledge fealty to the Society. Escaping by night in the direction of Rome, the lads
    were arrested by the city guards, and confessed that they had agreed to meet two
    Jesuits, who were waiting to conduct them on their journey.'<a
    name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173"
    class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>
    <p>It was, indeed, not the propagation of sound principles or liberal learning, but
    the aggrandizement of the order and the enforcement of Catholic usages, at which the
    Jesuits aimed in their scheme of education. This was noticeable in their attitude
    toward literature and science. Michelet has described their method in a brilliant and
    exact metaphor, as the attempt to counteract the poison of free thought and
    stimulative studies by means of vaccination. They taught the classics in expurgated
    editions, history in drugged epitomes, science in popular lectures. Instead of
    banning what M. Renan is wont to style <i>&eacute;tudes fortes</i>, they undertook to
    emasculate these and render them <span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"
    id="page285"></a>{285}</span> innocuous. While Bruno was burned by the Inquisition
    for proclaiming what the Copernican discovery involved for faith and metaphysics,
    Father Koster at Cologne vulgarized it into something pretty and agreeable. While
    Scaliger and Casaubon used the humanities as a propaedeutic of the virile reason, the
    Jesuits contrived to sterilize and mechanize their influences by insipid rhetoric.
    Everywhere through Europe, by the side of stalwart thinkers, crept plausible Jesuit
    professors, following the light of learning like its shadow, mimicking the accent of
    the gods like parrots, and mocking their gestures like apes. Their adroit admixture
    of falsehood with truth in all departments of knowledge, their substitution of veneer
    for solid timber, and of pinchbeck for sterling metal, was more profitable to the end
    they had in view than the torture-chamber of the Inquisition or the quarantine of the
    Index. Mediocrities and respectabilities of every description&mdash;that is to say,
    the majority of the influential classes&mdash;were delighted with their method. What
    could be better than to see sons growing up, good Catholics in all external
    observances, devoted to the order of society and Mother Church, and at the same time
    showy Latinists, furnished with a cyclopaedia of current knowledge, glib at
    speechifying, ingenious in the construction of an epigram or compliment? If some of
    the more sensible sort grumbled that Jesuit learning was shallow, and Jesuit morality
    of base alloy, the reply, like that of an Italian draper selling <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>{286}</span> palpable shoddy for
    broadcloth, came easily and cynically to the surface: <i>Imita bene</i>! The stuff is
    a good match enough! What more do you want? To produce plausible imitations, to save
    appearances, to amuse the mind with tricks, was the last resort of Catholicism in its
    warfare against rationalism. And such is the banality of human nature as a whole,
    that the Jesuits, those monopolists of Brummagem manufactures, achieved eminent
    success. Their hideous churches, daubed with plaster painted to resemble costly
    marbles, encrusted with stucco polished to deceive the eye, loaded with gewgaws and
    tinsel and superfluous ornament and frescoes, turning flat surfaces into cupolas and
    arcades, passed for masterpieces of architectonic beauty. The conceits of their
    pulpit oratory, its artificial cadences and flowery verbiage, its theatrical appeals
    to gross sensations, wrought miracles and converted thousands. Their sickly
    Ciceronian style, their sentimental books of piety, 'the worse for being warm,' the
    execrable taste of their poetry, their flimsy philosophy and disingenuous history,
    infected the taste of Catholic Europe like a slow seductive poison, flattering and
    accelerating the diseases of mental decadence. Sound learning died down beneath the
    tyranny of the Inquisition, the Index, the Council of Trent, Spain and the Papacy. A
    rank growth of unwholesome culture arose and flourished on its tomb under the
    forcing-frames of Jesuitry. But if we peruse the records of literature and science
    during the last three <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"
    id="page287"></a>{287}</span> centuries, few indeed are the eminences even of a
    second order which can be claimed by the Company of Jesus.</p>
    <p>The same critique applies to Jesuit morality. It was the Company's aim to control
    the conscience by direction and confession, and especially the conscience of princes,
    women, youths in high position. To do so by plain speaking and honest dealing was
    clearly dangerous. The world had had enough of Dominican austerity and dogmatism. To
    do so by open toleration and avowed cynicism did not suit the temper of the time. A
    reform of the monastic orders and the regular clergy had been undertaken by the
    Church. Pardoners, palmers, indulgence-mongers, jolly Franciscan confessors, and
    such-like folk were out of date. But the Jesuits were equal to the exigencies of the
    moment. We have seen how Ignatius recommended fishers of souls to humor queasy
    consciences. His successors expanded and applied the hint.&mdash;You must not begin
    by talking about spiritual things to people immersed in worldly interests. That is as
    simple as trying to fish without bait. On the contrary, you must insinuate yourself
    into their confidence by studying their habits, and spying out their propensities.
    You must appear to notice little at the first, and show yourself a good companion.
    When you become acquainted with the bosom sins and pleasant vices of folk in high
    position, you can lead them on the path of virtue at your pleasure. You must
    certainly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>{288}</span> tell
    them then that indulgence in sensuality, falsehood, fraud, violence, covetousness,
    and tyrannical oppression, is unconditionally wrong. Make no show of compromise with
    evil in the gross; but refine away the evil by distinctions, reservations,
    hypothetical conditions, until it disappears. Explain how hard it is to know whether
    a sin be venial or mortal, and how many chances there are against its being in any
    strict sense a sin at all. Do not leave folk to their own blunt sense of right and
    wrong, but let them admire the finer edge of your scalpel, while you shred up evil
    into morsels they can hardly see. A ready way may thus be opened for the satisfaction
    of every human desire without falling into theological faults. The advantages are
    manifest. You will be able to absolve with a clear conscience. Your penitent will
    abound in gratitude and open out his heart to you. You will fulfill your function as
    confessor and counselor. He will be secured for the sacred ends of our Society, and
    will contribute to the greater glory of God.&mdash;It was thus that the Jesuit
    labyrinth of casuistry, with its windings, turnings, secret chambers, whispering
    galleries, blind alleys, issues of evasion, came into existence; the whole vicious
    and monstrous edifice being crowned with the saving virtue of obedience, and the
    theory of ends justifying means. After the irony of Pascal, the condensed rage of La
    Chalotais, and the grave verdict of the Parlement of Paris (1762), it is not
    necessary now to refute the errors <span class="pagenum"><a name="page289"
    id="page289"></a>{289}</span> or to expose the abominations of this casuistry in
    detail.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Yet it cannot be wholly passed in
    silence here; for its application materially favored the influence of Jesuits in
    modern Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"
    id="page290"></a>{290}</span></p>
    <p>The working of the Company, as we have seen, depended upon a skillful manipulation
    of apparently hard-and-fast principles. The Declarations explained away the
    Constitutions; and an infinite number of minute exceptions and distinctions
    volatilized vows and obligations into ether. Transferring the same method to the
    sphere of ethics, they so wrought upon the precepts of the moral law, whether
    expressed in holy writ, in the ecclesiastical <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"
    id="page291"></a>{291}</span> decrees, or in civil jurisprudence, as to deprive them
    of their binding force. The subtlest elasticity had been gained for the machinery of
    the order by casuistical interpretation. A like elasticity was secured for the
    control and government of souls by an identical process. It was no wonder that the
    Jesuits became rapidly fashionable as confessors. The plainest prohibitions were as
    wax in their hands. The Decalogue laid down as rules for conduct: 'Thou shalt not
    steal;' 'Thou shalt not kill;' 'Thou shalt not commit adultery.' Christ spiritualized
    these rules into their essence: 'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself;' 'Whosoever
    looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery already with her in his
    heart.' It is manifest that both the old and the new covenant upon which modern
    Christianity is supposed to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"
    id="page292"></a>{292}</span> rest, suffered no transactions in matters so clear to
    the human conscience. Jesus himself refined upon the legality of the Mosaic code by
    defining sin as egotism or concupiscence. But the Company of Jesus took pains in
    their casuistry to provide attenuating circumstances for every sin in detail. By
    their doctrines of the invincible erroneous conscience, of occult compensation, of
    equivocation, of mental reservation, of probabilism, and of philosophical sin, they
    afforded loopholes for the gratification of every passion, and for the commission of
    every crime. Instead of maintaining that any injury done to a neighbor is wrong, they
    multiplied instances in which a neighbor may be injured. Instead of holding firm to
    Christ's verdict that sexual vice is implicit in licentious desire, they analyzed the
    sensual modes of crude voluptuousness, taxed each in turn at arbitrary values, and
    provided plausible excuses for indulgence. Instead of laying it down as a broad
    principle that men must keep their word, they taught them how to lie with spiritual
    impunity and with credit to their reputation as sons of the Church. Thus the
    inventive genius of the casuist, bent on dissecting immorality and reducing it to
    classes; the interrogative ingenuity of the confessor, pruriently inquisitive into
    private experience; the apologetic subtlety of the director, eager to supply his
    penitent with salves and anodynes; were all alike and all together applied to
    anti-social con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>{293}</span>
    tamination in matters of lubricity, and to anti-social corruption in matters of
    dishonesty, fraud, falsehood, illegality and violence. The single doctrine of
    probabilism, as Pascal abundantly proved, facilitates the commission of crime; for
    there is no perverse act which some casuist of note has not plausibly excused.</p>
    <p>It may be urged that confession and direction, as adopted by the Catholic Church,
    bring the abominations of casuistry logically in their train. Priests who have to
    absolve sinners must be familiar with sin in all its branches. In the confessional
    they will be forced to listen to recitals, the exact bearings of which they cannot
    understand unless they are previously instructed. Therefore the writings of Sanchez,
    Diana, Liguori, Burchard, Billuard, Rousselot, Gordon, Gaisson, are put into their
    hands at an early age&mdash;works which reveal more secrets of impudicity than
    Aretino has described, or Commodus can have practiced&mdash;works which recommend
    more craft and treachery and fraud and falsehood than Machiavelli accorded to his
    misbegotten Saviour of Society. In these writings men vowed to celibacy probe the
    foulest labyrinths of sexual impurity; men claiming to stand outside the civil order
    and the state, imbibe false theories upon property and probity and public duty.</p>
    <p>The root of the matter is wrong indubitably. It is contrary to good government
    that a sacerdotal class, by means of confession and direction, should be placed in a
    position of deciding upon conduct. It <span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"
    id="page294"></a>{294}</span> is revolting to human dignity that this same class,
    without national allegiance, and without domestic ties, should have the opportunity
    of infecting young minds by unhealthy questionings and dishonorable suggestions. But
    this wrong, which is inherent in the modern Catholic system, becomes an atrocity when
    it is employed, as the Jesuits employed it, as an instrument for moulding and
    controlling society in their own interest.</p>
    <p>While the Jesuits rendered themselves obnoxious to criticism by their treatment of
    the individual in his private and social capacity, they speedily became what Hallam
    cautiously styles 'rather dangerous supporters of the See of Rome' in public and
    political affairs. The ultimate failure of their diplomacy and intrigue over the
    whole field of modern statecraft inclines historians of the present epoch to
    underrate their mechanics of obstruction, and to underestimate the many occasions on
    which they did successfully retard the progress of civil government and intellectual
    freedom. It were wiser to regard them in the same light as fanatics laying stones
    upon a railway, or of dynamiters blowing up an emperor or a corner of Westminster
    Hall. The final end of the nefarious traffic may not be attained. But credit can be
    claimed by those who took their part in it, for the wreck of express trains, the
    perturbation of cities, and the mourning of peaceable families. And thus it was with
    the Jesuits. Though the results of their political intrigues had not corresponded to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>{295}</span> their hopes,
    they yet worked appreciable mischief by the organization of the League in France, and
    the Thirty Years' War in Germany, and by their revolutionary theories which infected
    Europe with conspiracy and murder. Their method was not original. Machiavelli had
    expounded the doctrines they put in practice. He taught that in a desperate state of
    the nation, men may have recourse to treachery and violence. The nation of the
    Jesuits was a hybrid between their order and Catholicism. The peril to the Church was
    imminent; its decadence demanded desperate remedies. They invoked regicide, revolt,
    and treason, to effect an impossible cure.</p>
    <p>The political theory of the Jesuits was deduced from their fundamental principle
    of obedience to the Church. They maintained that the ecclesiastical is <i>jure
    divino</i> superior to the secular power. The Pope through God's commission and
    appointment sways the Church; the Church takes rank above the State, as the soul
    above the body. Consequently, the first allegiance of a Christian nation, together
    with its secular rulers, belongs of right to the Supreme Pontiff. The people is the
    real sovereign; and kings are delegates from the people, with authority which they
    can only justly exercise so long as they remain in obedience to Rome. It follows from
    these positions that every nation must refuse fealty to an irreligious or
    contumacious ruler. In the last resort they may lawfully remove him by murder; and
    they <span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> are
    <i>ipso facto</i> in a state of mortal sin if they elect or recognize a heretic as
    sovereign. This theory sprang from the writings of the English Jesuits, Allen and
    Parsons. It was elaborated in Rome by Cardinal Bellarmino, applied in Spain by Suarez
    and Mariana, and openly preached in France by Jean Boucher. The best energies of
    Paolo Sarpi were devoted to combating the main position of ecclesiastical supremacy.
    His works had a salutary effect by delimiting the relations of the Church to the
    State, and by demonstrating even to Catholics the pernicious results of acknowledging
    a Papal overlordship in temporal affairs. At the same time the boldly democratic
    principle of the sovereignty of the people, which the Jesuits advanced in order to
    establish their doctrine of ecclesiastical superiority, provoked opposition. It led
    to the contrary hypothesis of the Divine Right of sovereigns, which found favor in
    Protestant kingdoms, and especially in England under the Stuart dynasty. When the
    French Catholics resolved to terminate the discords of their country by the
    recognition of Henri IV., they had recourse to this argument for justifying their
    obedience to a heretic. It was felt by all sound thinkers and by every patriot in
    Europe, that the Papal prerogatives claimed by the Jesuits were too inconsistent with
    national liberties to be tolerated. The zeal of the Society had clearly outrun its
    discretion; and the free discussion of the theory of government which their insolent
    assumptions <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>{297}</span>
    stimulated, weakened the cause they sought to strengthen. Their ingenuity overreached
    itself.</p>
    <p>This, however, was as nothing compared with the hostility evoked by their
    unscrupulous application of these principles in practice. There was hardly a plot
    against established rule in Protestant countries with which they were not known or
    believed to be connected. The invasion of Ireland in 1579, the murder of the Regent
    Morton in Scotland, and Babington's conspiracy against Elizabeth, emanated from their
    councils. They were held responsible for the attempted murder of the Prince of Orange
    in 1580, and for his actual murder in 1584. They loudly applauded Jacques
    Cl&eacute;ment, the assassin of Henri III. in 1589, as 'the eternal glory of
    France.'<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Numerous unsuccessful attacks
    upon the life of Henri IV., culminating in that of Jean Chastel in 1594, caused their
    expulsion from France. When they returned in 1603, they set to work again;<a
    name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176"
    class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and the assassin Ravaillac, who succeeded in removing the
    obnoxious champion of European independence in 1610, was probably inspired by their
    doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> They had a hand in the Gunpowder
    Plot of 1605, and were thought by some to have instigated the Massa<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>{298}</span> ere of S.
    Bartholomew. They fomented the League of the Guises, which had for its object a
    change in the French dynasty. They organized the Thirty Years' War, and they procured
    the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. If it is not possible to connect them
    immediately with all and each of the criminal acts laid to their charge, the fact
    that a Jesuit in every case was lurking in the background, counts by the force of
    cumulative evidence heavily against them, and explains the universal suspicion with
    which they came to be regarded as factious intermeddlers in the concerns of nations.
    Moreover, their written words accused them; for the tyrannicide of heretics was
    plainly advocated in their treatises on government. So profound was the conviction of
    their guilt, that the death of Sixtus V. in 1590, predicted by Bellarmino, the sudden
    death of Urban VII. in the same year, and the death of Clement VIII. in 1805, also
    predicted by Bellarmino&mdash;these three Popes being ill-affected toward the
    order&mdash;were popularly ascribed to their agency. But of their practical
    intervention there is no proof. Old age and fever must be credited, in these as in
    other cases, with the decease of Roman Pontiffs supposed to have been poisoned.</p>
    <p>It is not, however, to be wondered that sooner, or later the Jesuits made
    themselves insupportable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"
    id="page299"></a>{299}</span> by their intrigues in all the countries where they were
    established.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Even to the Papacy itself they
    proved too irksome to be borne. The Company showed plainly that what they meant by
    obedience to Rome was obedience to a Rome controlled and fashioned by themselves. It
    was their ambition to stand in the same relation to the Pope as the Shog&ucirc;n to
    the Mikado of Japan. Nor does the analysis of their opinions fail to justify the
    condemnation passed upon them by the Parlement of Paris in 1762. 'These doctrines
    tend to destroy the natural law, that rule of manners which God Himself has imprinted
    on the hearts of men, and in consequence to sever all the bonds of civil society, by
    the authorization of theft, falsehood, perjury, the most culpable impurity, and in a
    word each passion and each crime of human weakness; to obliterate all sentiments of
    humanity by favoring homicide and parricide; and to annihilate the authority of
    sovereigns in the State.'</p>
    <p>Great psychological and pathological interest, attaches to the study of the Jesuit
    order. To withhold our admiration from the zeal, energy, self-devotion and
    constructive ability of its founders, would be impossible. Equally futile would it be
    to affect indifference before the sinister spectacle of so world-<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>{300}</span> embracing an
    organism, persistently maintained in action for an anti-social end. There is
    something Roman in the colossal proportions of Loyola's idea, something Roman in the
    durability of the structure which perpetuates it. Yet the philosopher cannot but
    agree with the vulgar in his final judgment on the odiousness of these sacerdotal
    despots, these unflinching foes not merely to the heroes of the human intellect, and
    to the champions of right conduct, but also to the very angels of Christianity. That
    the Jesuits should claim to have been founded by Him who preached the Sermon on the
    Mount, that they should flaunt their motto, A.M.D.G., in the sight of Him who spake
    from Sinai, is one of those practical paradoxes in which the history of decrepit
    religions abounds.</p>

    <p>We are naturally led to inquire what discernible effect the Catholic Revival and
    the Counter-Reformation had upon the manners and morals of the Italians as a nation.
    Much has been said about the contrast between intellectual refinement and almost
    savage license which marked the Renaissance. Yet it can with justice be maintained
    that, while ferocity and brutal sensuality survived from the Middle Ages, humanism,
    by means of the new ideal it introduced, tended to civilize and educate the race.
    Now, however, the Church was stifling culture and attempting to restore that
    ecclesiastical conception of human life which the Renaissance had superseded. Did
    then her resuscitated Catholicism succeed in permeating the Italians with the spirit
    of Christ and of the Gospel? Were the nobles more quiet in their demeanor, less
    quarrelsome and haughty, more law-<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"

    had been in the previous period? Were the people more contented and less torn by
    factions, happier in their homes, less abandoned to the insanities of baleful
    superstitions?</p>
    <p>It is obviously difficult to answer these questions with either completeness or
    accuracy. In the first place, we have no right to expect that the religious revival,
    signalized by the Tridentine Council, should have made itself immediately felt in the
    sphere of national conduct. In the second place, it was not, like the German
    Reformation, a renewal of Christianity at its sources, but a resuscitation of
    mediaeval Catholicity, in direct antagonism to the intellectual tendencies of the
    age. The new learning among northern races disintegrated that system of ideas upon
    which mediaeval society rested; but it also introduced religious and moral
    conceptions more vital than those ideas in their decadence. In Italy the
    disintegrating process had been no less thorough, nay far more subtle and pervasive.
    Yet the new learning had not led the nation to attempt a reconstruction of primitive
    Christianity. The Catholic Revival gave nothing vital or enthusiastic to the
    conscience of the race. It brought the old creeds, old cult, old superstitions, old
    abuses back, with stricter discipline and under a <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of terror.
    Meanwhile, it resolutely ranged its forces in opposition to what had been salutary
    and life-giving in the mental movement of the Renaissance. It compelled people who
    had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>{303}</span> watched the
    dawning of a new light, to shut their eyes upon that dayspring. It extinguished the
    studies of the Classical Revival; bade philosophers return to Thomas of Aquino;
    threatened thinkers with the dungeon or the stake who should presume to pass the
    Pillars of Hercules, when a whole Atlantic of knowledge had been opened to their
    curiosity. Under these circumstances it was impossible that a revolution, so
    retrograde in its nature, checking the tide of national energy in full flow, should
    have exercised a healthy influence over the Italian temperament at large. We have a
    right to expect, what in fact we find, the advent of hypocrisy and ceremonial
    observances, but little actual amendment in manners. In the third place, the question
    is still further complicated by the Catholic Revival having been effected
    concurrently with the establishment of the Spanish Hegemony. At the end of the first
    chapter of this volume I pointed out the evils brought on Italy by her servitude to a
    foreign and unsympathetic despot: the decline of commercial activity, the
    multiplication of slothful lordlings, the depression of industry, the diminution of
    wealth, and the suffering of the lower classes from pirates, bandits and
    tax-gatherers. These conditions were sufficient to demoralize a people. And mediaeval
    Catholicism, restored by edict, enforced by the Inquisition, propagated by Jesuits,
    was not of the fine enthusiastic quality to counteract them. Servile in its
    conception, it sufficed to bridle and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"
    id="page304"></a>{304}</span> benumb a race of serfs, but not to soften or to purify
    their brutal instincts.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>
    <p>In this chapter I shall not attempt a general survey of Italian society.<a
    name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180"
    class="fnanchor">[180]</a> I shall content myself with supplying materials for the
    formation of a judgment by narrating some of the most remarkable domestic tragedies
    of the second half of the sixteenth century, choosing those only which rest upon
    well-sifted documentary evidence, and which bring the social conditions of the
    country into strong relief. Before engaging in these historical romances, it will be
    well to preface them with a few general remarks upon the state of manners they will
    illustrate.</p>
    <p>The first thing which strikes a student of Italy between 1530 and 1600 is that
    crimes of violence, committed by private individuals for personal ends, continued
    steadily upon the increase.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a><span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span></p>
    <p>Compared with the later Middle Ages, compared with the Renaissance, this period is
    distinguished by extraordinary ferocity of temper and by an almost unparalleled
    facility of bloodshed.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>
    <p>The broad political and religious contests which had torn the country in the first
    years of the sixteenth century, were pacified. Foreign armies had ceased to dispute
    the provinces of Italy. The victorious powers of Spain, the Church, and the protected
    principalities, seemed secure in the possession of their gains. But those
    international quarrels which kept the nation in unrest through a long period of
    municipal wars, ending in the horrors of successive invasions, were now succeeded by
    an almost universal discord between families and persons. Each province, each city,
    each village became the theater of private feuds and assassinations. Each household
    was the scene of homicide and empoisonment. Italy presented the spectacle of a nation
    armed against itself, not to decide the issue of antagonistic political principles by
    civil strife, but to gratify lawless passions&mdash;cupidity, revenge,
    resentment&mdash;by deeds of personal high-handedness. Among the common people of the
    country and the towns, crimes of brutality and bloodshed were of daily occurrence;
    every man bore weapons for self-defence, and for attack upon <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page306" id="page306"></a>{306}</span> his neighbor. The aristocracy and the
    upper classes of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> lived in a perpetual state of mutual
    mistrust, ready upon the slightest occasion of fancied affront to blaze forth into
    murder. Much of this savagery was due to the false ideas of honor and punctilio which
    the Spaniards introduced. Quarrels arose concerning a salute, a title, a question of
    precedence, a seat in church, a place in the prince's ante-chamber, a meeting in the
    public streets. Noblemen were ushered on their way by servants, who measured
    distances, and took the height of da&iuml;s or of bench, before their master
    committed his dignity by advancing a step beyond the minimum that was due.
    Love-affairs and the code of honor with regard to women opened endless sources of
    implacable jealousies, irreconcilable hatreds, and offenses that could only be wiped
    out with blood. On each and all of these occasions, the sword was ready to the right
    hand; and where this generous weapon would not reach, the harquebuss and knife of
    paid assassins were employed without compunction.<a name="FNanchor_183_183"
    id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> We
    must not, however, ascribe this condition of society wholly or chiefly to Spanish
    influences.</p>
    <p>It was in fact a survival of mediaeval habits under altered circumstances. During
    the municipal wars of the thirteenth <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"
    id="page307"></a>{307}</span> century, and afterwards during the struggle of the
    despots for ascendency, the nation had become accustomed to internecine contests
    which set party against party, household against household, man against man. These
    humors in the cities, as Italian historians were wont to call them, had been
    partially suppressed by the confederation of the five great Powers at the close of
    the fifteenth century, and also by a prevalent urbanity of manners. At that epoch,
    moreover, they were systematized and controlled by the methods of <i>condottiere</i>
    warfare, which offered a legitimate outlet to the passions of turbulent young men.
    But when Italy sank into the sloth of pacification after the settlement of Charles V.
    at Bologna in 1530, when there were no longer <i>condottieri</i> to levy troops in
    rival armies, when political parties ceased in the cities, the old humors broke out
    again under the aspect of private and personal feuds. Though the names of Guelf and
    Ghibelline had lost their meaning, these factions reappeared, and divided Milan, the
    towns of Romagna, the villages of the Campagna. In the place of <i>condottieri</i>
    arose brigand chiefs, who, like Piccolomini and Sciarra, placed themselves at the
    head of regiments, and swept the country on marauding expeditions. Instead of exiles,
    driven by victorious parties in the state to seek precarious living on a foreign
    soil, bandits, proscribed for acts of violence, abounded. Thus the habits which had
    been created through centuries of political ferment, subsisted when <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>{308}</span> the nation was at
    rest in servitude, assuming baser and more selfish forms of ferocity. The end of the
    sixteenth century witnessed the final degeneration and corruption of a mediaeval
    state of warfare, which the Renaissance had checked, but which the miseries of
    foreign invasions had resuscitated by brutalizing the population, and which now
    threatened to disintegrate society in aimless anarchy and private lawlessness.</p>
    <p>It must not be imagined that governments and magistracies were slack in their
    pursuit of criminals. Repressive statutes, proclamations of outlawry, and elaborate
    prosecutions succeeded one another with unwearied conscientiousness. The revenues of
    states were taxed to furnish blood-money and to support spies. Large sums were
    invariably offered for the capture or assassination of escaped delinquents; and woe
    to the wretches who became involved in criminal proceedings! Witnesses were tortured
    with infernal cruelty. Convicted culprits suffered horrible agonies before their
    death, or were condemned to languish out a miserable life in pestilential dungeons.
    But the very inhumanity of this judicial method, without mercy for the innocent, from
    whom evidence could be extorted, and frequently inequitable in the punishments
    assigned to criminals of varying degrees of guilt, taught the people to defy justice,
    and encouraged them in brutality. They found it more tolerable to join the bands of
    brigands who preyed upon their fields <span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"
    id="page309"></a>{309}</span> and villages, than to assist rulers who governed so
    unequally and cruelly. We know, for instance, that a robber chief, Marianazzo,
    refused the Pope's pardon, alleging that the profession of brigandage was more
    lucrative and offered greater security of life than any trade within the walls of
    Rome. Thus the bandits of that generation occupied the specious attitude of
    opposition to oppressive governments. There were, moreover, many favorable chances
    for a homicide. The Church was jealous of her rights of sanctuary. Whatever may have
    been her zeal for orthodoxy, she showed herself an indulgent mother to culprits who
    demanded an asylum. Feudal nobles prided themselves on protecting refugees within
    their fiefs and castles. There were innumerable petty domains left, which carried
    privileges of signorial courts and local justice. Cardinals, ambassadors, and
    powerful princes claimed immunity from common jurisdiction in their palaces, the
    courts and basements of which soon became the resort of escaped criminals. No
    extradition treaties subsisted between the several and numerous states into which
    Italy was then divided, so that it was only necessary to cross a frontier in order to
    gain safety from the law. The position of an outlaw in that case was tolerably
    secure, except against private vengeance or the cupidity of professional cut-throats,
    who gained an honest livelihood by murdering bandits with a good price on their
    heads. Condemned for the most part in their absence, these homicides <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>{310}</span> entered a recognized
    and not dishonorable class. They were tolerated, received, and even favored by
    neighboring princes, who generally had some grudge against the state from which the
    outlaws fled. After obtaining letters of safe-conduct and protection, they enrolled
    themselves in the militia of their adopted country, while the worst of them became
    spies or secret agents of police. No government seems to have regarded crimes of
    violence with severity, provided these had been committed on a foreign soil. Murders
    for the sake of robbery or rape were indeed esteemed ignoble. But a man who had
    killed an avowed enemy, or had shed blood in the heat of a quarrel, or had avenged
    his honor by the assassination of a sister convicted of light love, only established
    a reputation for bravery, which stood him in good stead. He was likely to make a
    stout soldier, and he had done nothing socially discreditable. On the contrary, if he
    had been useful in ridding the world of an outlaw some prince wished to kill, this
    murder made him a hero. In addition to the blood-money, he not unfrequently received
    lucrative office, or a pension for life.</p>
    <p>A very curious state of things resulted from these customs. States depended, in
    large measure, for the execution of their judicial sentences in cases of manslaughter
    and treason, upon foreign murderers and traitors. Towns were full of outlaws, each
    with a price upon his head, mutually suspicious, individually <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>{311}</span> desirous of killing
    some fellow-criminal and thereby enriching his own treasury. If he were successful,
    he received a fair sum of money, with privileges and immunities from the state which
    had advertised the outlaw; and not unfrequently he obtained the further right of
    releasing one or more bandits from penalties of death or prison. It may be imagined
    at what cross-purposes the outlaws dwelt together, with crimes in many states
    accumulated on their shoulders; and what peril might ensue to society should they
    combine together, as indeed they tried to do in Bedmar's conspiracy against Venice.
    Meanwhile, the states kept this floating population of criminals in check by various
    political and social contrivances, which grew up from the exigencies and the habits
    of the moment. Instead of recruiting soldiers from the stationary population, it
    became usual, when a war was imminent, to enroll outlaws. Thus, when Lucca had to
    make an inroad into Garfagnana in 1613, the Republic issued a proclamation promising
    pardon and pay to those of its own bandits who should join its standard. Men to the
    number of 591 answered this call, and the little war which followed was conducted
    with more than customary fierceness.<a name="FNanchor_184_184"
    id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>
    <p>Even the ordinary police and guards of cities were composed of fugitives from
    other states, care being taken to select by preference those who came stained only
    with honorable bloodshed. In 1593 the guard of the palace of Lucca was reinforced by
    the addition of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>{312}</span>
    forty-three men, among whom four were bandits for wounds inflicted upon enemies in
    open fight; twelve for homicide in duel, sword to sword; five for the murder of more
    than one person in similar encounters; one for the murder of a sister, and the
    wounding of her seducer; two for mutilating an enemy in the face; one for unlawful
    recruiting; one for wounding; one for countenancing bandits; and sixteen simple
    refugees.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The phrases employed to describe
    these men in the official report are sufficiently illustrative of contemporary moral
    standards. Thus we read 'Banditi per omicidi semplici <i>da buono a buono</i>, a
    sangue caldo, da spada a spada, <i>o di nemici</i>.' 'Per omicidio d'una sorella
    <i>per causa d'onore</i>.' To murder an enemy, or a sister who had misbehaved
    herself, was accounted excusable.</p>
    <p>The prevalence of lawlessness encouraged a domestic custom which soon grew into a
    system. This was the maintenance of so-called <i>bravi</i> by nobles and folk rich
    enough to afford so expensive a luxury. The outlaws found their advantage in the
    bargain which they drew with their employers; for besides being lodged, fed, clothed
    and armed, they obtained a certain protection from the spies and professional
    murderers who were always on the watch to kill them. Their masters used them to
    defend their persons when a feud was being carried on, or directed them against
    private enemies whom they wished to injure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"
    id="page313"></a>{313}</span></p>
    <p>It is not uncommon in the annals of these times to read: 'Messer So-and-so, having
    received an affront from the Count of V., employed the services of three
    <i>bravi</i>, valiant fellows up to any mischief, with whom he retired to his country
    house.' Or again: 'The Marquis, perceiving that his neighbor had a grudge against him
    on account of the Signora Lucrezia, thought it prudent to increase his bodyguard, and
    therefore added Pepi and Lo Scarabone, bandits from Tuscany for murders of a priest
    and a citizen, to his household.' Or again: 'During the vacation of the Holy See the
    Baron X had, as usual, engaged men-at-arms for the protection of his palace.'</p>
    <p>In course of time it became the mark of birth and wealth to lodge a rabble of such
    rascals. They lived on terms of familiarity with their employer, shared his secrets,
    served him in his amours, and executed any devil's job he chose to command.
    Apartments in the basement of the palace were assigned to them, so that a nobleman's
    house continued to resemble the castle of a mediaeval baron. But the <i>bravi</i>,
    unlike soldiery, were rarely employed in honorable business. They formed a permanent
    element of treachery and violence within the social organism. Not a little singular
    were the relations thus established. The community of crime, involving common
    interests and common perils, established a peculiar bond between the noble and his
    <i>bravo</i>. This was complexioned by a certain sense of 'honor rooted in dishonor,'
    and by a faint reflection from elder retainership. The compact <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> struck between
    landowner and bandit parodied that which drew feudal lord and wandering squire
    together. There was something ignobly noble in it, corresponding to the confused
    conscience and perilous conditions of the epoch.</p>
    <p>While studying this organized and half-tolerated system of social violence, we are
    surprised to observe how largely it was countenanced and how frequently it was set in
    motion by the Church. In a previous chapter on the Jesuits, I have adverted to their
    encouragement of assassination for ends which they considered sacred. In a coming
    chapter upon Sarpi, I shall show to what extent the Roman prelacy was implicated in
    more than one attempt to take away his life. The chiefs of the Church, then, instead
    of protesting against this vice of corrupt civilization in Italy, lent the weight of
    their encouragement to what strikes us now, not only as eminently unchristian, but
    also as pernicious to healthy national conditions of existence. We may draw two
    conclusions from these observations: first, that religions, except in the first
    fervor of their growth and forward progress, recognize the moral conventions of the
    society which they pretend to regulate: secondly, that it is well-nigh impossible for
    men of one century to sympathize with the ethics of a past and different epoch. We
    cannot comprehend the regicidal theories of the Jesuits, or the murderous intrigues
    of a Borghese Pontiff's Court, without admitting that priests, specially dedicated to
    the service of Christ and to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"
    id="page315"></a>{315}</span> propagation of his gospel, felt themselves justified in
    employing the immoral and unchristian means which social custom placed at their
    disposal for ridding themselves of inconvenient enemies. This is at the same time
    their defense as human beings in the sixteenth century, and their indictment as
    self-styled and professed successors of the Founder who rebuked Peter in the Garden
    of Gethsemane.</p>
    <p>To make general remarks upon the state of sexual morality at this epoch, is hardly
    needful. Yet there are some peculiar circumstances which deserve to be noticed, in
    order to render the typical stories which I mean to relate intelligible. We have
    already seen that society condoned the murder of a sister by a brother, if she
    brought dishonor on her family; and the same privilege was extended to a husband in
    the case of a notoriously faithless wife. Such homicides did not escape judicial
    sentence, but they shared in the conventional toleration which was extended to
    murders in hot blood or in the prosecution of a feud. The state of the Italian
    convents at this period gave occasion to crimes in which women played a prominent
    part. After the Council of Trent reforms were instituted in religious houses. But
    they could not be immediately carried out; and, meanwhile, the economical changes
    which were taking place in the commercial aristocracy, filled nunneries with girls
    who had no vocation for a secluded life. Less money was yearly made in trade;
    merchants became nobles, investing their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316"
    id="page316"></a>{316}</span> capital in land, and securing their estates on their
    eldest sons by entails. It followed that they could not afford to marry all their
    daughters with dowries befitting the station they aspired to assume. A large
    percentage of well-born women, accustomed to luxury, and vitiated by bad examples in
    their homes, were thus thrown on a monastic life. Signor Bonghi reckons that at the
    end of the sixteenth century, more than five hundred girls, who had become
    superfluous in noble families, crowded the convents in the single little town of
    Lucca. At a later epoch there would have been no special peril in this circumstance.
    But at the time with which we are now occupied, an objectionable license still
    survived from earlier ages. The nunneries obtained evil notoriety as houses of
    licentious pleasure, to which soldiers and youths of dissolute habits resorted by
    preference.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> There appears to have been a
    specific profligate fanaticism, a well-marked morbid partiality for these amours with
    cloistered virgins. The young men who prosecuted them, obtained a <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>{317}</span> nickname indicative
    of their absorbing passion.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> The attraction of mystery and
    danger had something, no doubt, to do with this infatuation; and the fascination that
    sacrilege has for depraved natures, may also be reckoned into the account. To enjoy a
    lawless amour was not enough; but to possess a woman who alternated between
    transports of passion and torments of remorse, added zest to guilty pleasure. For men
    who habitually tampered with magic arts and believed firmly in the devil, this raised
    romance to rapture. It was a common thing for debauchees to seek what they called
    <i>peripetezie di nuova idea</i>, or novel and exciting adventures stimulative of a
    jaded appetite, in consecrated places. At any rate, as will appear in the sequel of
    this chapter, convent intrigues occupied a large space in the criminal annals of the
    day.</p>
    <h4><i>The Lady of Monza</i></h4>
    <p>Virginia Maria de Leyva was a descendant of Charles V.'s general, Antonio de
    Leyva, who through many years administered the Duchy of Milan, and died loaded with
    wealth and honors.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a><span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span></p>
    <p>For his military service he was rewarded with the principality of Ascoli, the
    federal lordship of the town of Monza, and the life-tenure of the city of Pavia.
    Virginia's father was named Martino, and upon his death her cousin succeeded to the
    titles of the house. She, for family reasons, entered the convent of S. Margherita at
    Monza, about the year 1595. Here she occupied a place of considerable importance,
    being the daughter of the Lord of Monza, of princely blood, wealthy, and allied to
    the great houses of the Milanese. S. Margherita was a convent of the Umiliate,
    dedicated to the education of noble girls, in which, therefore, considerable laxity
    of discipline prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
    <p>Sister Virginia dwelt at ease within its walls, holding a kind of little court,
    and exercising an undefined authority in petty affairs which was conceded to her
    rank. Among her favorite companions at the time of the events I am about to narrate,
    were numbered the Sisters Ottavia Ricci, Benedetta Homata, Candida Brancolina, and
    Silvia Casata; she was waited on by a converse sister, Caterina da Meda. Adjoining
    the convent stood the house and garden of a certain Gianpaolo Osio, who plays the
    principal part in Virginia's tragedy. He must have been a young man of distinguished
    appearance; for when Virginia <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"
    id="page319"></a>{319}</span> first set eyes upon him from a window overlooking his
    grounds, she exclaimed: 'Is it possible that one could ever gaze on anything more
    beautiful?' He attracted her notice as early as the year 1599 or 1600, under
    circumstances not very favorable to the plan he had in view. His hands were red with
    the blood of Virginia's bailiff, Giuseppe Molteno, whom he had murdered for some
    cause unknown to us. During their first interview (Virginia leaning from the window
    of her friend Candida's cell, and Osio standing on his garden-plot beneath), the
    young man courteously excused himself for this act of violence, adding that he would
    serve her even more devotedly than the dead Molteno, and begging to be allowed to
    write her a letter. When the letter came, it was couched in terms expressive of a
    lawless passion. Virginia's noble blood rebelled against the insult, and she sent an
    answer back, rebuffing her audacious suitor. The go-betweens in the correspondence
    which ensued were the two nuns, Ottavia and Benedetta, and a certain Giuseppe Pesen,
    who served as letter-carrier. Osio did not allow himself to be discouraged by a first
    refusal, but took the hazardous step of opening his mind to the confessor of the
    convent, Paolo Arrigone, a priest of San Maurizio in Milan. Arrigone at once lent
    himself to the intrigue, and taught Osio what kind of letters he should write
    Virginia. They were to be courteous, respectful, blending pious rhetoric with
    mystical suggestions of romantic pas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"
    id="page320"></a>{320}</span> sion. It seems that the confessor composed these
    documents himself, and advised his fair penitent that there was no sin in perusing
    them. From correspondence, Osio next passed to interviews. By the aid of Arrigone he
    gained access to the parlor of the convent, where he conversed with Virginia through
    the bars. In their earlier meetings the lover did not venture beyond compliments and
    modest protestations of devotion. But as time went on, he advanced to kisses and
    caresses, and once he made Virginia take a little jewel into her mouth. This was a
    white loadstone, blessed by Arrigone, and intended to operate like a love-charm. The
    girl, in fact, began to feel the influence of her seducer. In the final confession
    which she made, she relates how she fought against temptation. 'Some diabolical force
    compelled me to go to the window overlooking his garden; and one day when Sister
    Ottavia told me that Osio was standing there, I fainted from the effort to restrain
    myself. This happened several times. At one moment I flew into a rage, and prayed to
    God to help me; at another I felt lifted from the ground, and forced to go and gaze
    on him. Sometimes when the fit was on me, I tore my hair; I even thought of killing
    myself.' Virginia was surrounded by persons who had an interest in helping Osio. Not
    only the confessor, who was a man of infamous character, but her friends among the
    nuns, themselves accustomed to intrigue of a like nature, led her down the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>{321}</span> path to ruin. False
    keys were made, and one or other of the faithless sisters introduced the young man
    into the convent at night. When Virginia resisted, and enlarged upon the sacrilege of
    breaking cloister, Arrigone supplied her with a printed book of casuistry, in which
    it was written that though it might be sinful for a nun to leave her convent, there
    was no sin in a man entering it. At last she fell; and for seven years she lived in
    close intimacy with her lover, passing the nights with him, either in his own house
    or in one of the cells of S. Margherita. On one occasion, when he had to fly from
    justice, the girls concealed him in their rooms for fifteen days. The first fruit of
    this amour was a stillborn child; after giving birth to which, Virginia sold all the
    silver she possessed, and sent a votive tablet to Our Lady of Loreto, on which she
    had portrayed a nun and baby, kneeling and weeping. 'Twice again I sent the same
    memorial to our Lady, imploring the grace of liberation from this passion. But the
    sorceries with which I was surrounded, prevailed. In my bed were found the bones of
    the dead, hooks of iron, and many other things, of which the nuns were well informed.
    Nay, I would fain have given up my life to save my soul; and so great were my
    afflictions, that in despair I went to throw myself into the well, but was restrained
    by the image of the Virgin at the bottom of the garden, for which I had a special
    devotion.' In course of time she gave birth to a little girl, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>{322}</span> named Francesca, who
    frequented the convent, and whom Osio legitimated as his child.</p>
    <p>It was impossible that a connection of long standing, known to several
    accomplices, and corroborated by the presence of the child Francesca, should remain
    hidden from the world. People began to speak about the fact in Monza. A druggist,
    named Reinaro Soncini, gossiped somewhat too openly. Osio had him shot one night by a
    servant in his pay.</p>
    <p>And now the lovers were engaged in a career of crime, which brought them finally
    to justice. Virginia's waiting-woman Caterina fell into disgrace with her mistress,
    and was shut up in a kind of prison by her orders. The girl declared that she would
    bring the whole bad affair before the superior authorities, and would do so
    immediately, seeing that Monsignor Barca, the Visitor of S. Margherita, was about to
    make one of his official tours of inspection.</p>
    <p>This threat cost Caterina her life. About midnight, while a thunder-storm was
    raging, Virginia, accompanied by her usual associates, Ottavia, Benedetta, Silvia,
    and Candida, entered the room where the girl was confined. They were followed by
    Osio, holding in his hand a heavy instrument of wood and iron, called <i>piede di
    bicocca</i>, which he had snatched up in the convent outhouse. He found Caterina
    lying face downward on the bed, and smashed her skull with a single blow. The body
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>{323}</span> was conveyed by
    him and the nuns into the fowl-house of the sisters, whence he removed it on the
    following night by the aid of Benedetta into his own dwelling. From evidence which
    afterwards transpired, Osio decapitated the corpse, concealed the body in a sort of
    cellar, and flung the head into an empty well at Velate.</p>
    <p>The disappearance of Caterina just before the visitation of Monsignor Barca,
    roused suspicion; and, though a murder was not immediately apprehended, the guilty
    associates felt that the cord of fate was being drawn around them. In the autumn of
    1607 the tempest broke upon their heads. Virginia was removed from Monza to the
    convent called Del Bocchetto at Milan; and on November 27 the depositions of the
    abbess, prioress, and other members of S. Margherita were taken regarding Osio's
    intrigues, the assassination of Soncini, and the disappearance of Caterina.</p>
    <p>Among the nuns who had abetted Osio, the two most criminally implicated were
    Ottavia and Benedetta. Their evidence, if closely scrutinized, must reveal each
    secret of the past. It was much to Osio's interest, therefore, that they should not
    fall into the hands of justice; nor had he any difficulty in persuading them to rely
    on his assistance for contriving their escape to some convent in the Bergamasque
    territory. We may wonder, by the way, what sort of discipline was then maintained in
    nunneries, if two so guilty sisters counted upon safe <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page324" id="page324"></a>{324}</span> entrance into an asylum, provided only
    they could leave the diocese of Milan for another.<a name="FNanchor_190_190"
    id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> On
    the night of Thursday, November 30, 1607, Osio came to the wall of the convent
    garden, and began to break a hole in it, through which Ottavia and Benedetta crept.
    The three then prowled along the city wall of Monza, till they found a breach wide
    enough for exit. Afterwards they took a path beside the river Lambro, and stopped for
    awhile at the church of the Madonna delle Grazie. Here the sisters prayed for
    assistance from our Lady in their journey, and recited the <i>Salve Regina</i> seven
    times. Then they resumed their walk along the Lambro, and at a certain point Ottavia
    fell into the river. In her dying depositions she accused Osio of having pushed her
    in; and there seems little doubt that he did so; for while she was struggling in the
    water, he disengaged his harquebuss from his mantle and struck her several blows upon
    the head and hands.</p>
    <p>She pretended to be dead, and was carried down the stream to a place where she
    contrived to crawl to land. Some peasants came by, whose assistance she implored. But
    they, observing that she was a nun of S. Margherita by her dress, refused to house
    her for the rest of the night. They gave her a staff to lean on, and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id="page325"></a>{325}</span> after a painful
    journey she regained the church of the Grazie at early dawn. Ottavia's wounds upon
    the head, face, and right hand, inflicted by the stock of Osio's gun, were so serious
    that after making a clean breast to her judges, she died of them upon December 26,
    1607.</p>
    <p>When Osio had pushed Ottavia into the Lambro, and had tried to smash her brains
    out with his harquebuss, he resumed his midnight journey with Sister Benedetta. They
    reached an uninhabited house in the country about five or six miles distant from
    Monza. Here Osio shut Benedetta up in an empty room with a stone bench running along
    the wall. She remained there all Friday, visited once by her dreaded companion, who
    brought her bread, cheese, and wine. She abstained from touching any of this food, in
    fear of poison. About nine in the evening he returned, and bade her prepare to march.
    They set out again, together, in the dark; and after walking about three miles they
    came to a well, down which Osio threw her. The well was deep, and had no water in it.
    Benedetta injured her left side in the fall; and when she had reached the bottom, her
    would-be murderer flung a big stone on her which broke her right leg. She contrived
    to protect her head by gathering stones around it, and lay without moaning or moving,
    in the fear that Osio would attempt fresh violence unless he thought her dead. From
    the middle of Friday night, until Sunday morning, she remained thus, exploring with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>{326}</span> her eyes the
    surface of her dungeon. It was dry and strewn with bones. In one corner lay a round
    black object which bore the aspect of a human skull. As it eventually turned out,
    this was the head of Caterina, whom Benedetta herself had helped to murder, and which
    Osio had thrown there. On Sunday, during Mass, the men of the village of Velate were
    in church, when they heard a voice from outside calling out, 'Help, help! I am at the
    bottom of this well!' The well, as it happened, was distant some dozen paces from the
    church door, and Benedetta had timed her call for assistance at a lucky moment. The
    villagers ran to the spot, and drew her out by means of a man who went down with a
    rope. She was then taken to the house of a gentleman, Signor Alberico degli Alberici,
    who, when no one else was charitable enough to receive her, opened his doors to the
    exhausted victim of that murderous outrage. It may be remarked that the same surgeon
    who had been employed to report on Ottavia's wounds, now appeared to examine
    Benedetta. His name was Ambrogio Vimercati. Benedetta was taken to the convent of S.
    Orsola, where her friend Ottavia lay dying; and after making a full confession, she
    eventually recovered her health, and suffered life-long incarceration in her old
    convent.</p>
    <p>Osio was still at large. On December 20, he addressed a long letter to the
    Cardinal Federigo Borromeo, in which he vainly attempted to defend <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>{327}</span> himself, and throw
    the blame on his associates. It is a loathsome document, blending fulsome
    protestations and fawning phrases, with brutal denouncements of his victims, and
    treacherous insinuations. One passage deserves notice. 'Who was it,' he says, 'who
    suggested my correspondence with Virginia? The priest Paolo Arrigone, that ruin of
    the monastery! The Canon Pisnato, who is now confessor to the nuns of Meda; in his
    house you will find what will never be discovered in mine, presents from nuns,
    incitements to amours, and other such things. The priest Giacomo Bertola, confessor
    of the nuns of S. Margherita; who was his devotee? Sacha!&mdash;and he stayed there
    all the day through. These men, being priests, are not prosecuted; they are protected
    by their cloth, forsooth! It is only of poor Osio that folk talk. Only he is
    persecuted, only he is a malefactor, only he is the traitor!' Arrigone, as a matter
    of fact, was tried, and condemned to two years' labor at the galleys, after the
    expiration of which term he was not to return to Monza or its territory. This seems a
    slight sentence; for the judges found him guilty, not only of promoting Osio's
    intrigue with Virginia, by conducting the correspondence, and watching the door
    during their interviews in the parlor, but also of pursuing the Signora himself with
    infamous proposals.</p>
    <p>In his absence Osio was condemned to death on the gibbet. His goods were
    confiscated to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"
    id="page328"></a>{328}</span> State. His house in Monza was destroyed, and a pillar
    of infamy recording his crimes, was erected on its site. A proclamation of outlawry
    was issued on April 5, 1608, under the seal of Don Pietro de Acevedo, Count of
    Fuentes, and governor of the State of Milan, which offered 'to any person not himself
    an outlaw, or to any commune, that shall consign Gianpaolo Osio to the hands of
    justice, the reward of a thousand scudi from the royal ducal treasury, together with
    the right to free four bandits condemned for similar or less offenses; and in case of
    his being delivered dead, even though he shall be slain in foreign parts, then the
    half of the aforesaid sum of money, and the freedom of two bandits as above. And if
    the person who shall consign him alive be himself an outlaw for similar or less
    offenses, he shall receive, beside the freedom of himself and two other bandits, the
    half of the aforesaid sum of money; and in the case of his consignment after death,
    the freedom of himself and of two other bandits as aforesaid.' I have recited this
    <i>Bando</i>, because it is a good instance of the procedure in use under like
    conditions. Justice preferred to obtain the culprit alive, and desired to receive him
    at honest hands. But there was an expectation of getting hold of him through less
    reputable agents. Therefore they offered free pardon to a bandit and a couple of
    accomplices, who might undertake the capture or the murder of the proscribed outlaw
    in concert, and in the event of his being produced alive, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page329" id="page329"></a>{329}</span> a sum of money down. Osio, apparently,
    spent some years in exile, changing place, and name, and dress, living as he could
    from hand to mouth, until the rumor spread abroad that he was dead. He then returned
    to his country, and begged for sanctuary from an old friend. That friend betrayed
    him, had his throat cut in a cellar, and exposed his head upon the public market
    place.</p>
    <p>Virginia was sentenced to perpetual incarceration in the convent of S. Valeria at
    Milan. She was to be 'inclosed within a little dungeon, the door of which shall be
    walled up with stones and mortar, so that the said Virginia Maria shall abide there
    for the term of her natural life, immured both day and night, never to issue thence,
    but shall receive food and other necessaries through a small hole in the wall of the
    said chamber, and light and air through an aperture or other opening.' This sentence
    was carried into effect. But at the expiration of many years, her behavior justified
    some mitigation of the penalty. She was set at large, and allowed to occupy a more
    wholesome apartment, where the charity of Cardinal Borromeo supplied her with
    comforts befitting her station, and the reputation she acquired for sanctity. Her own
    family cherished implacable sentiments of resentment against the woman who had
    brought disgrace upon them. Ripamonte, the historian of Milan, says that in his own
    time she was still alive: 'a bent old woman, tall of stature, dried and fleshless,
    but venerable in her aspect, whom no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"
    id="page330"></a>{330}</span> one could believe to have been once a charming and
    immodest beauty.' Her associates in guilt, the nuns of S. Margherita, were consigned
    to punishments resembling hers. Sisters Benedetta, Silvia and Candida suffered the
    same close incarceration.</p>
    <h4><i>Lucrezia Buonvisi</i></h4>
    <p>The tale of Lucrezia Buonvisi presents some points of similarity to that of the
    Signora di Monza.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>
    <p>Her father was a Lucchese gentleman, named Vincenzo Malpigli, who passed the
    better portion of his life at Ferrara, as treasurer to Duke Afonsono II. He had four
    children; one son, Giovan Lorenzo, and three daughters, of whom Lucrezia, born at
    Lucca in 1572, was probably the youngest. Vincenzo's wife sprang from the noble
    Lucchese family of Buonvisi, at that time by their wealth and alliances the most
    powerful house of the Republic. Lucrezia spent some years of her girlhood at Ferrara,
    where she formed a romantic friendship for a nobleman of Lucca named Massimiliano
    Arnolfini. This early attachment was not countenanced by her parents. They destined
    her to be the wife of one of Paolo Buonvisi's numerous sons, her relatives upon the
    mother's side. In consequence of this determination, she was first affianced to an
    heir of that house, who died; again to another, who also died; and in the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>{331}</span> third place to their
    brother, called Lelio, whom she eventually married in the year 1591. Lelio was then
    twenty-five years of age, and Lucrezia nineteen. Her beauty was so distinguished,
    that in poems written on the ladies of Lucca it received this celebration in a
    madrigal:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">

        </span> <span class="i4">While Cupid plays and Flora laughs in her fresh
        hue.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Less than a year after her marriage with Lelia Buonvisi, Lucrezia resumed her
    former intimacy with Massimiliano Arnolfini. He was scarcely two yeara her elder, and
    they had already exchanged vows of fidelity in Ferrara. Massimiliano's temper
    inclined him to extreme courses; he was quick and fervent in all the disputes of his
    age, ready to back his quarrels with the sword, and impatient of delay in any matter
    he had undertaken. Owing to a feud which then subsisted between the families of
    Arnolfini and Boccella, he kept certain <i>bravi</i> in his service, upon whose
    devotion he relied. This young man soon found means to open a correspondence with
    Lucrezia, and arranged meetings with her in the house of some poor weavers who lived
    opposite the palace of the Buonvisi. Nothing passed between them that exceeded the
    limits of respectful court<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"
    id="page332"></a>{332}</span> ship. But the situation became irksome to a lover so
    hot of blood as Massimiliano was. On the evening of June 5, in 1593, his men attacked
    Lelio Buonvisi, while returning with Lucrezia from prayers in an adjacent church.
    Lelio fell, stabbed with nineteen thrusts of the poignard, and was carried lifeless
    to his house. Lucrezia made her way back alone; and when her husband's corpse was
    brought into the palace, she requested that it should be laid out in the basement. A
    solitary witness of this act of violence, Vincenzo di Coreglia, deposed to having
    raised the dying man from the ground, put earth into his mouth by way of Sacrament,
    and urged him to forgive his enemies before he breathed his last. The weather had
    been very bad that day, and at nightfall it was thundering incessantly.</p>
    <p>Inquisition was made immediately into the causes of Lelio's death. According to
    Lucrezia's account, her husband had reproved some men upon the road for singing
    obscene songs, whereupon they turned and murdered him. The corpse was exposed in the
    Church of the Servi, where multitudes of people gathered round it; and there an
    ancient dame of the Buonvisi house, flinging herself upon her nephew's body, vowed
    vengeance, after the old custom of the <i>Vocero</i>, against his murderers. Other
    members of the family indicated Massimiliano as the probable assassin; but he
    meantime had escaped, with three of his retainers, to a villa of his mother's at S.
    Pancrazio, whence he managed to take the open <span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"
    id="page333"></a>{333}</span> country and place himself in temporary safety. During
    this while, the judicial authorities of Lucca were not idle. The Podest&agrave;
    issued a proclamation inviting evidence, under the menace of decapitation and
    confiscation of goods for whomsoever should be found to have withheld information. To
    this call a certain Orazio Carli, most imprudently, responded. He confessed to having
    been aware that Massimiliano was plotting the assassination of somebody&mdash;not
    Lelio; and said that he had himself facilitated the flight of the assassins by
    preparing a ladder, which he placed in the hands of a <i>bravo</i> called Ottavio da
    Trapani. This revelation delivered him over, bound hand and foot, to the judicial
    authorities, who at the same time imprisoned Vincenzo da Coreglia, the soldier
    present at the murder.</p>
    <p>Massimiliano and his men meanwhile had made their way across the frontier to
    Garfagnana. Their flight, and the suspicions which attached to them, rendered it
    tolerably certain that they were the authors of the crime. But justice demanded more
    circumstantial information, and the Podest&agrave; decided to work upon the two men
    already in his clutches. On June 4, Carli was submitted to the torture. The rack
    elicited nothing new from him, but had the result of dislocating his arms. He was
    then placed upon an instrument called the 'she-goat,' a sharp wooden trestle, to
    which the man was bound with weights attached to his feet, and where he sat for
    nearly four hours. In the course of this painful <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page334" id="page334"></a>{334}</span> exercise, he deposed that Massimiliano
    and Lucrezia had been in the habit of meeting in the house of Vincenzo del Zoppo and
    Pollonia his wife, where the <i>bravi</i> also congregated and kept their arms. Grave
    suspicion was thus cast on Lucrezia. Had she perchance connived at her husband's
    murder? Was she an accomplice in the tragedy?</p>
    <p>Lucrezia's peril now became imminent. Her brother, Giovan Lorenzo Malpigli, who
    remained her friend throughout, thought it best for her to retire as secretly as
    possible into a convent. The house chosen was that of S. Chiara in the town of Lucca.
    On June 5, she assumed the habit of S. Francis, cut her hair, changed her name from
    Lucrezia to Umilia, and offered two thousand crowns of dower to this monastery. Only
    four days had elapsed since her husband's assassination. But she, at all events, was
    safe from immediate peril; for the Church must now be dealt with; and the Church
    neither relinquished its suppliants, nor disgorged the wealth they poured into its
    coffers. The Podest&agrave;, when news of this occurrence reached him, sent at once
    to make inquiries. His messenger, Ser Vincenzo Petrucci, was informed by the Abbess
    that Lucrezia had just arrived and was having her hair shorn. At his request, the
    novice herself appeared&mdash;'a young woman, tall and pale, dressed in a nun's
    habit, with a crown upon her head.' She declared herself to be 'Madonna Lucretiina
    Malpigli, widow of Lelio Buonvisi.' The priest who had conducted <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>{335}</span> her reception,
    affirmed that 'the gentle lady, immediately upon her husband's death, conceived this
    good prompting of the spirit, and obeyed it on the spot.'</p>
    <p>For the moment, Lucrezia, whom in future we must call Sister Umilia, had to be
    left unmolested. The judges returned to the interrogation of their prisoners.
    Vincenzo del Zoppo and his wife Pollonia, in whose house the lovers used to meet,
    were tortured; but nothing that implied a criminal correspondence transpired from
    their evidence. Then the unlucky Carli was once more put to the strappado. He fell
    into a deep swoon, and was with difficulty brought to life again. Next his son, a
    youth of sixteen years, was racked with similar results. On June 7, they resolved to
    have another try at Vincenzo da Coreglia. This soldier had been kept on low diet in
    his prison during the last week, and was therefore ripe, according to the judicial
    theories of those times, for salutary torments. Having been strung up by his hands,
    he was jerked and shaken in the customary fashion, until he declared his willingness
    to make a full confession. He had been informed, he said, that Massimiliano intended
    to assassinate Lelio by means of his three bravi, Pietro da Castelnuovo, Ottavio da
    Trapani, and Niccolo da Pariana. He engaged to stand by and cover the retreat of
    these men. It was Carli, and not Massimiliano, who had made overtures to him. On
    being once more tortured, he only confirmed this confession. Carli was <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>{336}</span> again summoned, and
    set upon the 'she-goat,' with heavy weights attached to his feet. The poor wretch sat
    for two hours on this infernal machine, the sharp edges and spikes of which were so
    contrived as to press slowly and deeply upon the tenderest portions of his body.<a
    name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192"
    class="fnanchor">[192]</a> But he endured this agony without uttering a word, until
    the judges perceived that he was at the point of death. Next day, the 8th of June,
    Coreglia was again summoned to the justice-chamber. Terrified by the prospect of
    future torments, and wearied out with importunities, he at last made a clean breast
    of all he knew. It was not Carli, but Massimiliano himself, who had engaged him; and
    he had assisted at the murder of Lelio, which was accomplished by two of the bravi,
    Ottavio and Pietro. Coreglia said nothing to implicate Sister Umilia. On the contrary
    he asserted that she seemed to lose her senses when she saw her husband fall.</p>
    <p>The General Council, to whom the results of these proceedings were communicated,
    published an edict of outlawry against Massimiliano and his three <i>bravi</i>. A
    price of 500 crowns was put upon the head of each, wherever he should be killed; and
    1,000 crowns were offered to any one who should kill<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page337" id="page337"></a>{337}</span> Massimiliano within the city or state of
    Lucca. At the same time they sent an envoy to Rome requesting the Pope's permission
    to arrest Umilia, on the ground that she was gravely suspected of being privy to the
    murder, and of entering the convent to escape justice. A few days afterwards, the
    miserable witnesses, Carli and Coreglia, were beheaded in their prison.</p>
    <p>The Chancellor, Vincenzo Petrucci, left Lucca on June 12, and reached Rome on the
    14th. He obtained an audience from Clement VIII. upon the 15th. When the Pope had
    read the letter of the Republic, he struck his palm down on his chair, and cried:
    'Jesus! This is a grave case! It seems hardly possible that a woman of her birth
    should have been induced to take share in the murder of her husband.' After some
    conversation with the envoy, he added: 'It is certainly an ugly business. But what
    can we do now that she has taken the veil?' Then he promised to deliberate upon the
    matter, and return an answer later. Petrucci soon perceived that the Church did not
    mean to relinquish its privileges, and that Umilia was supported by powerful friends
    at court. Cardinal Castrucci remarked in casual conversation: 'She is surely punished
    enough for her sins by the life of the cloister.' A second interview with Clement on
    June 21 confirmed him in the opinion that the Republic would not obtain the
    dispensation they requested. Meanwhile the Signory of Lucca prepared a schedule of
    the suspicions against Umilia, grounded upon her <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page338" id="page338"></a>{338}</span> confused evidence, her correspondence
    with Massimiliano, the fact that she had done nothing to rescue Lelio by calling out,
    and her sudden resort to the convent. This paper reached the Pope, who, on July 8,
    expressed his view that the Republic ought to be content with leaving Umilia immured
    in her monastery; and again, upon the 23rd, he pronounced his final decision that
    'the lady, being a nun, and tonsured and prepared for the perfect life, is not within
    the jurisdiction of your Signory. It is further clear that, finding herself exposed
    to the calumnies of those two witnesses, and injured in her reputation, she took the
    veil to screen her honor.' On August 13, Petrucci returned to Lucca.</p>
    <p>Clement conceded one point. He gave commission to the Bishop of Lucca to inquire
    into Umilia's conduct within the precincts of the monastery. But the council refused
    this intervention, for they were on bad terms with the Bishop, and resented
    ecclesiastical interference in secular causes. Moreover, they judged that such an
    inquisition without torture used, and in a place of safety, would prove worse than
    useless. Thus the affair dropped.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile we may relate what happened to Massimiliano and his <i>bravi</i>. They
    escaped, through Garfagnana and Massa, into the territory of Alfonso Malaspina,
    Marquis of Villafranca and Tresana. This nobleman, who delighted in protecting
    outlaws, placed the four men in security in his stronghold of Tresana. Pietro da
    Castelnuovo was an outlaw <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"
    id="page339"></a>{339}</span> from Tuscany for the murder of a Carmelite friar, which
    he had committed at Pietrasanta a few days before the assassination of Lelio.
    Seventeen years after these events he was still alive, and wanted for grave crimes
    committed in the Duchy of Modena. History knows no more about him, except that he had
    a wife and family. Of Niccolo da Pariana nothing has to be related. Ottavio da
    Trapani was caught at Milan, brought back to Lucca, and hanged there on June 13,
    1604, after being torn with pincers. Massimiliano is said to have made his way to
    Flanders, where the Lucchese enjoyed many privileges, and where his family had
    probably hereditary connections.<a name="FNanchor_193_193"
    id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Like
    all outlaws he lived in perpetual peril of assassination. Remorse and shame invaded
    him, especially when news arrived that the mistress, for whom he had risked all, was
    turning to a dissolute life (as we shall shortly read) in her monastery. His reason
    gave way; and, after twenty-two years of wandering, he returned to Lucca and was
    caught. Instead of executing the capital sentence which had been pronounced upon him,
    the Signory consigned him to perpetual prison in the tower of Viareggio, which was
    then an insalubrious and fever-stricken village on the coast. Here, walled up in a
    little room, alone, deprived of light and air and physical decency, he remained
    forgotten for ten years from 1615 to 1625. At the latter date <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span> report was made that
    he had refused food for three days and was suffering from a dangerous hemorrhage.
    When the authorities proposed to break the wall of his dungeon and send a priest and
    surgeon to relieve him, he declared that he would kill himself if they intruded on
    his misery. Nothing more was heard of him until 1629, when he was again reported to
    be at the point of death. This time he requested the assistance of a priest; and it
    is probable that he then died at the age of sixty-nine, having survived the other
    actors in this tragedy, and expiated the passion of his youth by life-long
    sufferings.</p>
    <p>When we return to Sister Umilia, and inquire how the years had worn with her, a
    new chapter in the story opens. In 1606 she was still cloistered in S. Chiara, which
    indeed remained her home until her death. She had now reached the age of thirty-four.
    Suspicion meanwhile fell upon the conduct of the nuns of S. Chiara; and on January 9,
    in that year, a rope-ladder was discovered hanging from the garden wall of the
    convent. Upon inquiry, it appeared that certain men were in the habit of entering the
    house and holding secret correspondence with the sisters. Among these the most
    notorious were Piero Passari, a painter, infamous for vulgar profligacy, and a young
    nobleman of Lucca, Tommaso Samminiati. Both of them contrived to evade justice, and
    were proclaimed, as usual, outlaws. In the further course of investigation the
    strongest proofs were brought to light, from which it appeared <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id="page341"></a>{341}</span> that the chief
    promoter of these scandals was a man of high position in the state, advanced in
    years, married to a second wife, and holding office of trust as Protector of the
    Nunnery of S. Chiara. He was named Giovanbattista Dati, and represented an ancient
    Lucchese family mentioned by Dante. While Dati carried on his own intrigue with
    Sister Cherubina Mei, he did his best to encourage the painter in promiscuous
    debauchery, and to foster the passion which Samminiati entertained for Sister Umilia
    Malpigli. Dati was taken prisoner and banished for life to the island of Sardinia;
    but his papers fell into the hands of the Signory, who extracted from them the
    evidence which follows, touching Umilia and Samminiati. This young man was ten years
    her junior; yet the quiet life of the cloister had preserved Umilia's beauty, and she
    was still capable of inspiring enthusiastic adoration. This transpires in the letters
    which Samminiati addressed to her through Dati from his asylum in Venice. They
    reveal, says Signor Bonghi, a strange confusion of madness, crime, and love.<a
    name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194"
    class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>
    <p>Their style is that of a delirious rhetorician. One might fancy they had been
    composed as exercises, except for certain traits which mark the frenzy of genuine
    exaltation. Threats, imprecations, and blasphemies alternate with prayers, vows of
    fidelity and reminiscences of past delights in love. Samminiati bends <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>{342}</span> before 'his lady' in
    an attitude of respectful homage, offering upon his knees the service of awe-struck
    devotion. At one time he calls her 'his most beauteous angel,' at another 'his most
    lovely and adored enchantress.' He does not conceal his firm belief that she has laid
    him under some spell of sorcery; but entreats her to have mercy and to liberate him,
    reminding her how a certain Florentine lady restored Giovan Lorenzo Malpigli to
    health after keeping him in magic bondage till his life was in danger.<a
    name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"
    class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Then he swears unalterable fealty; heaven and fortune
    shall not change his love. It is untrue that at Florence, or at Venice, he has cast
    one glance on any other woman. Let lightning strike him, if he deserts Umilia. But
    she has caused him jealousy by stooping to a base amour. To this point he returns
    with some persistence. Then he entreats her to send him her portrait, painted in the
    character of S. Ursula. At another time he gossips about the nuns, forwarding
    messages, alluding to their several love-affairs, and condoling with them on the loss
    of a compliant confessor. This was a priest, who, when the indescribable corruptions
    of S. Chiara had been clearly proved, calmly remarked that there was no reason to
    make such a fuss&mdash;they were only affairs of gentlefolk, <i>cose di
    gentilhuomini</i>. The rival of whom Samminiati was jealous seems to have <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>{343}</span> been the painter
    Pietro, who held the key to all the scandals of the convent in his hand. Umilia,
    Dati, and Samminiati at last agreed 'to rid their neighborhood of that pest.' The man
    had escaped to Rovigo, whither Samminiati repaired from Venice, 'attended by two good
    fellows thoroughly acquainted with the district.'</p>
    <p>But Pietro got away to Ferrara, his enemy following and again missing him.
    Samminiati writes that he is resolved to hunt 'that rascal' out, and make an end of
    him. Meanwhile Umilia is commissioned to do for Calidonia Burlamacchi, a nun who had
    withdrawn from the company of her guilty sisters, and knew too many of their secrets.
    Samminiati sends a white powder, and a little phial containing a liquid, both of
    which, he informs Umilia, are potent poisons, with instructions how to use them and
    how to get Calidonia to swallow the ingredients. Then 'if the devil does not help
    her, she will pass from this life in half a night's time, and without the slightest
    sign of violence.'</p>
    <p>It may be imagined what disturbance was caused in the General Council by the
    reading of this correspondence. Nearly all the noble families of Lucca were connected
    by ties of blood or marriage with one or other of the culprits; and when the
    relatives of the accused had been excluded from the session, only sixty members were
    left to debate on further measures. I will briefly relate what happened to the three
    outlaws. Venice refused to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"
    id="page344"></a>{344}</span> give up Samminiati at the request of the Lucchese,
    saying that 'the Republic of S. Mark would not initiate a course of action
    prejudicial to the hospitality which every sort of person was wont to enjoy there.'
    But the young man was banished to Candia, whither he obediently retired. Pietro, the
    painter, was eventually permitted to return to the territory but not the town of
    Lucca. Dati surrounded himself with armed men, as was the custom of rich criminals on
    whose head a price was set. After wandering some time, he submitted, and took up his
    abode in Sardinia, whence he afterwards removed, by permission of the Signory, to
    France. There he died. With regard to the nuns, it seemed at first that the ends of
    justice would be defeated through the jealousies which divided the civil and
    ecclesiastical authorities in Lucca. The Bishop was absent, and his Vicar refused to
    institute a criminal process. Umilia remained at large in the convent, and even began
    a new intrigue with one Simo Menocchi. At last, in 1609, the Vicar prepared his
    indictment against the guilty nuns, and forwarded it to Rome. Their sentence was as
    follows: Sister Orizia condemned to incarceration for life, and loss of all her
    privileges; Sister Umilia, to the same penalties for a term of seven years; Sisters
    Paola, Cherubina, and Dionea, received a lighter punishment. Orizia, it may be
    mentioned, had written a letter with her own blood to some lover; but nothing leads
    us to suppose that she was equally guilty with Umilia, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page345" id="page345"></a>{345}</span> who had entered into the plot to poison
    Sister Calidonia.</p>
    <p>Umilia was duly immured, and bore her punishment until the year 1616, at which
    time the sentence expired. But she was not released for another two years; for she
    persistently refused to humble herself, or to request that liberation as a grace
    which was her due in justice. Nor would she submit to the shame of being seen about
    the convent without her monastic habit. Finally, in 1618, she obtained freedom and
    restoration to her privileges as a nun of S. Chiara. It may be added, as a last
    remark, that, when the convent was being set to rights, Umilia's portrait in the
    character of S. Ursula was ordered to be destroyed, or rendered fit for devout uses
    by alterations. Any nun who kept it in her cell incurred the penalty of
    excommunication. In what year Umilia died remains unknown.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;' />
    <h4><i>The Cenci</i></h4>
    <p>Shifting the scene to Rome, we light upon a group of notable misdeeds enacted in
    the last half of the sixteenth century, each of which is well calculated to
    illustrate the conditions of society and manners at that epoch. It may be well to
    begin with the Cenci tragedy. In Shelley's powerful drama, in Guerrazzi's tedious
    novel, and Scolari's digest, the legend of Beatrice Cenci has long appealed to modern
    sympathy. The real facts, extracted from legal documents and public registers, reduce
    its poetry of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span>
    horror to comparatively squalid prose.<a name="FNanchor_196_196"
    id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Yet,
    shorn of romantic glamour, the bare history speaks significantly to a student of
    Italian customs. Monsignore Cristoforo Cenci, who died about the year 1562, was in
    holy orders, yet not a priest. One of the clerks of the Apostolic Camera, a Canon of
    S. Peter's, the titular incumbent of a Roman parish, and an occupant of minor offices
    about the Papal Court and Curia, he represented an epicene species, neither churchman
    nor layman, which the circumstances of ecclesiastical sovereignty rendered
    indispensable. Cristoforo belonged to a good family among that secondary Roman
    aristocracy which ranked beneath the princely feudatories and the Papal bastards. He
    accumulated large sums of money by maladministration of his official trusts,
    inherited the estates of two uncles, and bequeathed a colossal fortune to his son
    Francesco. This youth was the offspring of an illicit connection carried on between
    Monsignore Cenci and Beatrice Amias during the lifetime of that lady's husband. Upon
    the death of the husband the Monsignore obtained dispensation from his orders,
    married Beatrice, and legitimated his son, the inheritor of so much wealth. Francesco
    was born in 1549, and had therefore reached the age of thirteen when his father died.
    His mother, Beatrice, soon contracted a third matrimonial union; but during her
    guardianship of the boy she appeared before the <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page347" id="page347"></a>{347}</span> courts, accused of having stolen
    clothing from his tutor's wardrobe.</p>
    <p>Francesco Cenci disbursed a sum of 33,000 crowns to various public offices, in
    order to be allowed to enter unmolested into the enjoyment of his father's gains:
    3,800 crowns of this sum went to the Chapter of S. Peter's.<a name="FNanchor_197_197"
    id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> He
    showed a certain precocity; for at the age of fourteen he owned an illegitimate
    child, and was accused of violence to domestics. In 1563 his family married him to
    Ersilia, a daughter of the noble Santa Croce house, who brought him a fair dowry.
    Francesco lived for twenty-one years with this lady, by whom he had twelve children.
    Upon her death he remained a widower for nine years, and in 1593 he married Lucrezia
    Petroni, widow of a Roman called Velli. Francesco's conduct during his first marriage
    was not without blame. Twice, at least, he had to pay fines for acts of brutality to
    servants; and once he was prosecuted for an attempt to murder a cousin, also named
    Francesco Cenci. On another occasion we find him outlawed from the States of the
    Church. Yet these offences were but peccadilloes in a wealthy Roman baron; and
    Francesco used to boast that, with money in his purse, he had no dread of justice.
    After the death of his wife Ersilia, his behavior grew more irregular. Three times
    between 1591 and 1594 he was sued for violent attacks on servants; and in <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>{348}</span> February of the
    latter year he remained six months in prison on multiplied charges of unnatural vice.
    There was nothing even here to single Francesco Cenci out from other nobles of his
    age.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198"
    class="fnanchor">[198]</a> Scarcely a week passed in Rome without some affair of the
    sort involving outrage, being brought before the judges. Cardinals, prelates,
    princes, professional men and people of the lowest rank were alike implicated. The
    only difference between the culprits was that the rich bought themselves off, while
    the destitute were burned. Eleven poor Spaniards and Portuguese were sent to the
    stake in 1578 for an offence which Francesco Cenci compounded in 1594 by the payment
    of 100,000 crowns. After this warning and the loss of so much money, he grew more
    circumspect, married his second wife Lucrezia, and settled down to rule his family.
    His sons caused him considerable anxiety. Giacomo, the eldest, married against his
    father's will, and supported <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349"
    id="page349"></a>{349}</span> himself by forging obligations and raising money.
    Francesco's displeasure showed itself in several lawsuits, one of which accused
    Giacomo of having plotted against his life. The second son, Cristoforo, was
    assassinated by Paolo Bruno, a Corsican, in the prosecution of a love affair with the
    wife of a Trasteverine fisherman. The third son, Rocco, spent his time in street
    adventures, and on one occasion laid his hands on all the plate and portable property
    that he could carry off from his father's house. This young ruffian, less than twenty
    years of age, found a devoted friend in Monsignore Querro, a cousin of the family
    well placed at court, who assisted him in the burglary of the Cenci palace. Rocco was
    killed by Amilcare Orsini, a bastard of the Count of Pitigliano, in a brawl at night.
    The young men met, Cenci attended by three armed servants, Orsini by two. A single
    pass of rapiers, in which Rocco was pierced through the right eye, ended the
    affair.</p>
    <p>In addition to his vindictive persecution of his worthless eldest son, Francesco
    Cenci behaved with undue strictness to the younger, allowing them less money than
    befitted their station and treating them with a severity which contrasted comically
    with his own loose habits. The legend which represents him as an exceptionally wicked
    man, cruel for cruelty's sake and devoid of natural affection, receives some color
    from the facts. Yet these alone are not sufficient to justify its darker hues, while
    they amply <span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id="page350"></a>{350}</span>
    prove that Francesco's children gave him grievous provocation. The discontents of
    this ill-governed family matured into rebellion; and in 1598 it was decided on
    removing the old Cenci by murder. His second wife Lucrezia, his eldest son Giacomo,
    his daughter Beatrice, and the youngest son Bernardo, were implicated in the crime.
    It was successfully carried out at the Rocca di Petrella in the Abruzzi on the night
    of September 9. Two hired <i>bravi</i>, Olimpio Calvetti and Marzio Catalani, entered
    the old man's bedroom, drove a nail into his head, and flung the corpse out from a
    gallery, whence it was alleged that he had fallen by accident. Six days after this
    assassination Giacomo and his brothers took out letters both at Rome and in the realm
    of Naples for the administration of their father's property; nor does suspicion seem
    for some time to have fallen upon them. It awoke at Petrella in November, the
    feudatory of which fief, Marzio Colonna, informed the government of Naples that
    proceedings ought to be taken against the Cenci and their cut-throats. Accordingly,
    on December 10, a ban was published against Olimpio and Marzio. Olimpio met his death
    at an inn door in a little village called Cantalice. Three desperate fellows, at the
    instigation of Giacomo de'Cenci and Monsignore Querro, surprised him there. But
    Marzio fell into the hands of justice, and his evidence caused the immediate arrest
    of the Cenci. It appears that they were tortured and that none of <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>{351}</span> them denied the
    accusation; so that their advocates could only plead extenuating circumstances. To
    this fact may possibly be due the legend of Beatrice. In order to mitigate the guilt
    of parricide, Prospero Farinacci, who conducted her defense, established a theory of
    enormous cruelty and unspeakable outrages committed on her person by her father. With
    the same object in view, he tried to make out that Bernardo was half-witted. There is
    quite sufficient extant evidence to show that Bernardo was a young man of average
    intelligence; and with regard to Beatrice, nothing now remains to corroborate
    Farinaccio's hypothesis of incest. She was not a girl of sixteen, as the legend runs,
    but a woman of twenty-two;<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and the codicils to her will
    render it nearly certain that she had given birth to an illegitimate son, for whose
    maintenance she made elaborate and secret provisions. That the picture ascribed to
    Guido Reni in the Barberini palace is not a portrait of Beatrice in prison, appears
    sufficiently proved. Guido did not come to Rome until 1608, nine years after her
    death; and catalogues of the Barberini gallery, compiled in 1604 and 1623, contain no
    mention either of a painting by Guido or of Beatrice's portrait. The Cenci were
    lodged successively in the prisons of Torre di Nona, Savelli, and S. Angelo. They
    occupied wholesome apartments and were allowed the attendance of their own <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>{352}</span> domestics. That their
    food was no scanty dungeon fare appears from the <i>menus</i> of dinners and suppers
    supplied to them, which include fish, flesh, fruit salad, and snow to cool the water.
    In spite of powerful influence at court, Clement VIII. at last resolved to exercise
    strict justice on the Cenci. He was brought to this decision by a matricide
    perpetrated in cold blood at Subiaco, on September 5, 1599. Paolo di S. Croce, a
    relative of the Cenci, murdered his mother Costanza in her bed, with the view of
    obtaining property over which she had control. The sentence issued a few days after
    this event. Giacomo was condemned to be torn to pieces by red hot pincers, and
    finished with a <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> from the hangman's hammer. Lucrezia and
    Beatrice received the slighter sentence of decapitation; while Bernardo, in
    consideration of his youth, was let off with the penalty of being present at the
    execution of his kinsfolk, after which he was to be imprisoned for a year and then
    sent to the galleys for life. Their property was confiscated to the Camera
    Apostolica. These punishments were carried out.<a name="FNanchor_200_200"
    id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> But
    Bernardo, after working at Civit&agrave; Vecchia until 1606, obtained release and
    lived in banishment till his death in 1627. Monsignor Querro, for his connivance in
    the whole affair, was banished to the island of Malta, whence he returned at some
    date before the year 1633 to Rome, having expiated his <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page353" id="page353"></a>{353}</span> guilt by long and painful exile. In this
    abstract of the Cenci tragedy, I have followed the documents published by Signor
    Bertolotti. They are at many points in startling contradiction to the legend, which
    is founded on MS. accounts compiled at no distant period after the events. One of
    these was translated by Shelley; another, differing in some particulars, was
    translated by De Stendhal. Both agree in painting that lurid portrait of Francesco
    Cenci which Shelley has animated with the force of a great dramatist.<a
    name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201"
    class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Unluckily, no copy of the legal instructions upon which
    the trial was conducted is now extant. In the absence of this all-important source of
    information, it would be unsafe to adopt Bertolotti's argument, that the legend
    calumniates Francesco in order to exculpate Beatrice, without some reservation. There
    is room for the belief that facts adduced in evidence may have partly justified the
    prevalent opinion of Beatrice's infamous persecution by her father.</p>

    <h4><i>The Massimi</i></h4>
    <p>The tragedy of the Cenci, about which so much has been written in consequence of
    the supposed part taken in it by Beatrice, seems to me common-place compared with

    <p>Whether this family really descended from the Roman Fabii matters but little. In
    the sixteenth century they ranked, as they still rank, among the proudest nobles of
    the Eternal City. Lelio, the head of the house, had six stalwart sons by his first
    wife, Girolama Savelli. They were conspicuous for their gigantic stature and
    herculean strength. After their mother's death in 1571, their father became enamoured
    of a woman inferior at all points, in birth, breeding, and antecedents, to a person
    of his quality. She was a certain Eufrosina, who had been married to a man called
    Corberio. The great Marc Antonio Colonna murdered this husband, and brought the wife
    to Rome as his own mistress. Lelio Massimo committed the grand error of so loving
    her, after she had served Colonna's purpose, that he married her. This was an insult
    to the honor of the house, which his sons could not or would not bear. On the night
    of her wedding, in 1585, they refused to pay her their respects; and on the next
    morning, five of them entered her apartments and shot her dead. Only one of the six
    sons, Pompeo Massimo, bore no share in this assassination. Him, the father, Lelio,
    blessed; but he solemnly cursed the other five. After the lapse of a few weeks, he
    followed his wife to the grave with a broken heart, leaving this imprecation
    unrecalled. Pompeo grew up to continue the great line of Massimo. But disaster fell
    on each of his five brothers, the flower of Roman youth, exulting in their blood, and
    insolence, and vigor.&mdash;The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"
    id="page355"></a>{355}</span> first of them, Ottavio, was killed by a cannon-ball at
    sea in honorable combat with the Turk. Another, Girolamo, who sought refuge in
    France, was shot down in an ambuscade while pursuing his amours with a gentle lady. A
    third, Alessandro, died under arms before Paris in the troops of General Farnese. A
    fourth, Luca, was imprisoned at Rome for his share of the step-mother's murder, but
    was released on the plea that he had avenged the wounded honor of his race. He died,
    however, poisoned by his own brother, Marcantonio, in 1599.<a name="FNanchor_203_203"
    id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
    Marcantonio was arrested on suspicion and imprisoned in Torre di Nona, where he
    confessed his guilt. He was shortly afterwards beheaded on the little square before
    the bridge of S. Angelo.</p>
    <h4><i>Vittoria Accoramboni</i></h4>
    <p>Next in order, I shall take the story of Vittoria Accoramboni. It has been often
    told already,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> yet it combines so many points of
    interest bearing upon the social life of the Italians in my period, that to omit it
    would be to sacrifice the most important document bearing on the matter of this
    chapter. As the Signora di Monza and Lucrezia Buonvisi <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page356" id="page356"></a>{356}</span> help us to understand the secret history
    of families and convents, so Vittoria Accoramboni introduces us to that of
    courts.</p>
    <p>It will be noticed how the same machinery of lawless nobles and profligate
    <i>bravi</i>, acting in concert with bold women, is brought into play throughout the
    tragedies which form the substance of our present inquiry.</p>
    <p>Vittoria was born in 1557, of a noble but impoverished family, at Gubbio among the
    hills of Umbria. Her biographers are rapturous in their praises of her beauty, grace,
    and exceeding charm of manner. Not only was her person most lovely, but her mind
    shone at first with all the amiable luster of a modest, innocent, and winning youth.
    Her father, Claudio Accoramboni, removed to Rome, where his numerous children were
    brought up under the care of their mother, Tarquinia, an ambitious woman, bent on
    rehabilitating the decayed honors of her house. Here Vittoria in early girlhood soon
    became the fashion. She exercised an irresistible influence over all who saw her, and
    many were the offers of marriage she refused. At length a suitor appeared whose
    condition and connection with the Roman ecclesiastical nobility rendered him
    acceptable in the eyes of the Accoramboni. Francesco Peretti was welcomed as the
    successful candidate for Vittoria's hand. His mother, Camilla, was sister to Felice,
    Cardinal of Montalto; and her son, Francesco Mignucci, had changed both of his names
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> to Felice
    Peretti in compliment to this illustrious relative.<a name="FNanchor_205_205"
    id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>
    <p>It was the nephew, then, of the future Sixtus V., that Vittoria Accoramboni
    married on June 28, 1573. For a short while the young couple lived happily together.
    According to some accounts of their married life, the bride secured the favor of her
    powerful uncle-in-law, who indulged her costly fancies to the full. It is, however,
    more probable that the Cardinal Montalto treated her follies with a grudging
    parsimony; for we soon find the Peretti household hopelessly involved in debt.
    Discord, too, arose between Vittoria and her husband on the score of levity in her
    behavior; and it was rumored that even during the brief space of their union she had
    proved a faithless wife. Yet she contrived to keep Francesco's confidence, and it is
    certain that her family profited by their connection with the Peretti. Of her six
    brothers, Mario, the eldest, was a favorite courtier of the great Cardinal d'Este.
    Ottavio was in orders, and through Montalto's influence obtained the See of
    Fossombrone. The same eminent protector placed Scipione in the service of the
    Cardinal Sforza. Camillo, famous for his beauty and his courage, followed the
    fortunes of Filibert of Savoy, and died in France. Flaminio was still a boy,
    dependent, as the sequel of this story shows, upon his sister's destiny.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>{358}</span></p>
    <p>Of Marcello, the second in age and most important in the action of this tragedy,
    it is needful to speak with more particularity. He was young, and, like the rest of
    his breed, singularly handsome&mdash;so handsome, indeed, that he is said to have
    gained an infamous ascendency over the great Duke of Bracciano, whose privy
    chamberlain he had become. Marcello was an outlaw for the murder of Matteo
    Pallavicino, the brother of the Cardinal of that name. This did not, however, prevent
    the chief of the Orsini house from making him his favorite and confidential friend.
    Marcello, who seems to have realized in actual life the worst vices of those Roman
    courtiers described for us by Aretino, very soon conceived the plan of exalting his
    own fortunes by trading on his sister's beauty. He worked upon the Duke of
    Bracciano's mind so cleverly that he brought this haughty prince to the point of an
    insane passion for Peretti's young wife; and meanwhile he so contrived to inflame the
    ambition of Vittoria and her mother, Tarquinia, that both were prepared to dare the
    worst of crimes in expectation of a dukedom. The game was a difficult one to play.
    Not only had Francesco Peretti first to be murdered, but the inequality of birth and
    wealth and station between Vittoria and the Duke of Bracciano rendered a marriage
    almost impossible. It was also an affair of delicacy to stimulate without satisfying
    the Duke s passion. Yet Marcello did not despair. The stakes were high enough to
    justify great risks; and all he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page359"
    id="page359"></a>{359}</span> put in peril was his sister's honor, the fame of the
    Accoramboni, and the favor of Montalto. Vittoria, for her part, trusted in her power
    to ensnare and secure the noble prey both had in view.</p>
    <p>Paolo Giordano Orsini, born about the year 1637, was reigning Duke of Bracciano.
    Among Italian princes he ranked almost upon a par with the Dukes of Urbino; and his
    family, by its alliances, was more illustrious than any of that time in Italy. He was
    a man of gigantic stature, prodigious corpulence, and marked personal daring;
    agreeable in manners, but subject to uncontrollable fits of passion, and incapable of
    self-restraint when crossed in any whim or fancy. Upon the habit of his body it is
    needful to insist, in order that the part he played in this tragedy of intrigue,
    crime, and passion may be well defined. He found it difficult to procure a charger
    equal to his weight, and he was so fat that a special dispensation relieved him from
    the duty of genuflexion in the Papal presence. Though lord of a large territory,
    yielding princely revenues, he labored under heavy debts; for no great noble of the
    period lived more splendidly, with less regard for his finances. In the politics of
    that age and country, Paolo Giordano leaned towards France. Yet he was a grandee of
    Spain, and had played a distinguished part in the battle of Lepanto. Now, the Duke of
    Bracciano was a widower. He had been married in 1553 to Isabella de'Medici, daughter
    of the Grand, Duke Cosimo, sister of Francesco,<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page360" id="page360"></a>{360}</span> Bianca Capello's lover, and of the
    Cardinal Ferdinando. Suspicion of adultery with Troilo Orsini had fallen on Isabella;
    and her husband, with the full concurrence of her brothers, removed her in 1576 from
    this world by poison.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> No one thought the worse of
    Bracciano for this murder of his wife. In those days of abandoned vice and intricate
    villany, certain points of honor were maintained with scrupulous fidelity. A wife's
    adultery was enough to justify the most savage and licentious husband in an act of
    semi-judicial vengeance; and the shame she brought upon his head was shared by the
    members of her own house, so that they stood by, consenting to her death. Isabella,
    it may be said, left one son, Virginio, who became, in due time, Duke of
    Bracciano.</p>
    <p>It appears that in the year 1581, four years after Vittoria's marriage, the Duke
    of Bracciano satisfied Marcello of his intention to make her his wife, and of his
    willingness to countenance Francesco Peretti's murder. Marcello, feeling sure of his
    game, now introduced the Duke in private to his sister, and induced her to overcome
    any natural repugnance she may have felt for the unwieldy and gross lover. Having
    reached this point, it was imperative to push matters quickly on toward
    matrimony.</p>
    <p>But how should the unfortunate Francesco be <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page361" id="page361"></a>{361}</span> entrapped? They caught him in a snare of
    peculiar atrocity, by working on the kindly feelings which his love for Vittoria had
    caused him to extend to all the Accoramboni. Marcello, the outlaw, was her favorite
    brother, and Marcello at that time lay in hiding, under the suspicion of more than
    ordinary crime, beyond the walls of Rome. Late in the evening of April 18, while the
    Peretti family were retiring to bed, a messenger from Marcello arrived, entreating
    Francesco to repair at once to Monte Cavallo. Marcello had affairs of the utmost
    importance to communicate, and begged his brother-in-law not to fail him at a
    grievous pinch. The letter containing this request was borne by one Dominico
    d'Aquaviva, <i>alias</i> Il Mancino, a confederate of Vittoria's waiting-maid. This
    fellow, like Marcello, was an outlaw; but when he ventured into Rome he frequented
    Peretti's house, and he had made himself familiar with its master as a trusty bravo.
    Neither in the message, therefore, nor in the messenger was there much to rouse
    suspicion. The time, indeed, was oddly chosen, and Marcello had never made a similar
    appeal on any previous occasion. Yet his necessities might surely have obliged him to
    demand some more than ordinary favor from a brother. Francesco immediately made
    himself ready to start out, armed only with his sword and attended by a single
    servant. It was in vain that his wife and his mother reminded him of the dangers of
    the night, the loneliness of Monte<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"
    id="page362"></a>{362}</span> Cavallo, its ruinous palaces and robber-haunted caves.
    He was resolved to undertake the adventure, and went forth, never to return. As he
    ascended the hill, he fell to earth, shot with three harquebusses. His body was
    afterwards found on Monte Cavallo, stabbed through and through, without a trace that
    could identify the murderers. Only, in the course of subsequent investigations, Il
    Mancino (February 24, 1582) made the following statements:&mdash;That Vittoria's
    mother, assisted by the waiting woman, had planned the trap; that Marchionne of
    Gubbio and Paolo Barca of Bracciano, two of the Duke's men, had despatched the
    victim. Marcello himself, it seems, had come from Bracciano to conduct the whole
    affair. Suspicion fell immediately upon Vittoria and her kindred, together with the
    Duke of Bracciano; nor was this diminished when the Accoramboni, fearing the pursuit
    of justice, took refuge in a villa of the Duke's at Magnanapoli a few days after the
    murder.</p>
    <p>A cardinal's nephew, even in those troublous times, was not killed without some
    noise being made about the matter. Accordingly, Pope Gregory XIII. began to take
    measures for discovering the authors of the crime. Strange to say, however, the
    Cardinal Montalto, notwithstanding the great love he was known to bear his nephew,
    begged that the investigation might be dropped. The coolness with which he first
    received the news of Francesco Peretti's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"
    id="page363"></a>{363}</span> death, the dissimulation with which he met the Pope's
    expression of sympathy in a full consistory, his reserve while greeting friends on
    ceremonial visits of condolence, and, more than all, the self-restraint he showed in
    the presence of the Duke of Bracciano, impressed the society of Rome with the belief
    that he was of a singularly moderate and patient temper. It was thought that the man
    who could so tamely submit to his nephew's murder, and suspend the arm of justice
    when already raised for vengeance, must prove a mild and indulgent ruler. When,
    therefore, in the fifth year after this event, Montalto was elected Pope, men
    ascribed his elevation in no small measure to his conduct at the present crisis.
    Some, indeed, attributed his extraordinary moderation and self-control to the right
    cause. '<i>Veramente costui &egrave; un gran frate</i>!' was Gregory's remark at the
    close of the consistory when Montalto begged him to let the matter of Peretti's
    murder rest. '<i>Of a truth, that fellow is a consummate hypocrite</i>!' How accurate
    this judgment was, appeared when Sixtus V. assumed the reins of power. The priest
    who, as monk and cardinal, had smiled on Bracciano, though he knew him to be his
    nephew's assassin, now, as Pontiff and sovereign, bade the chief of the Orsini purge
    his palace and dominions of the scoundrels he was wont to harbor, adding
    significantly, that if the Cardinal Felice Peretti forgave what had been done against
    him in a private station, the same man would exact uttermost ven<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>{364}</span> geance for
    disobedience to the will of Sixtus. The Duke of Bracciano judged it best, after that
    warning, to withdraw from Rome.</p>
    <p>Francesco Peretti had been murdered on April 16, 1581. Sixtus V. was proclaimed on
    April 24, 1585. In this interval Vittoria underwent a series of extraordinary perils
    and adventures. First of all, she had been secretly married to the Duke in his
    gardens of Magnanapoli at the end of April 1581. That is to say, Marcello and she
    secured their prize, as well as they were able, the moment after Francesco had been
    removed by murder. But no sooner had the marriage become known, than the Pope, moved
    by the scandal it created, no less than by the urgent instance of the Orsini and
    Medici, declared it void. After some while spent in vain resistance, Bracciano
    submitted, and sent Vittoria back to her father's house. By an order issued under
    Gregory's own hand, she was next removed to the prison of Corte Savella, thence to
    the monastery of S. Cecilia in Trastevere, and finally to the Castle of S. Angelo.
    Here at the end of December 1581, she was put on her trial for the murder of her
    first husband. In prison she seems to have borne herself bravely, arraying her
    beautiful person in delicate attire, entertaining visitors, exacting from her friends
    the honors due to a duchess, and sustaining the frequent examinations to which she
    was submitted with a bold, proud front. In the middle of the month of July her
    constancy was sorely tried by the receipt of a letter in <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page365" id="page365"></a>{365}</span> the Duke's own handwriting, formally
    renouncing his marriage. It was only by a lucky accident that she was prevented on
    this occasion from committing suicide. The Papal court meanwhile kept urging her
    either to retire to a monastery or to accept another husband. She firmly refused to
    embrace the religious life, and declared that she was already lawfully united to a
    living husband, the Duke of Bracciano. It seemed impossible to deal with her; and at
    last, on November 8, she was released from prison under the condition of retirement
    to Gubbio. The Duke had lulled his enemies to rest by the pretense of yielding to
    their wishes. But Marcello was continually beside him at Bracciano, where we read of
    a mysterious Greek enchantress whom he hired to brew love-philters for the
    furtherance of his ambitious plots. Whether Bracciano was stimulated by the brother's
    arguments or by the witch's potions need not be too curiously questioned. But it
    seems in any case certain that absence inflamed his passion instead of cooling
    it.</p>
    <p>Accordingly, in September 1583, under the excuse of a pilgrimage to Loreto, he
    contrived to meet Vittoria at Trevi, whence he carried her in triumph to Bracciano.
    Here he openly acknowledged her as his wife, installing her with all the splendor due
    to a sovereign duchess. On October 10 following, he once more performed the marriage
    ceremony in the principal church of his fief; and in the January of 1584 he brought
    her openly to Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366"
    id="page366"></a>{366}</span> This act of contumacy to the Pope, both as feudal
    superior and as Supreme Pontiff, roused all the former opposition to his marriage.
    Once more it was declared invalid. Once more the Duke pretended to give way. But at
    this juncture Gregory died; and while the conclave was sitting for the election of
    the new Pope, he resolved to take the law into his own hands, and to ratify his union
    with Vittoria by a third and public marriage in Rome. On the morning of April 24,
    1585, their nuptials were accordingly once more solemnized in the Orsini palace. Just
    one hour after the ceremony, as appears from the marriage-register, the news arrived
    of Cardinal Montalto's election to the Papacy. Vittoria lost no time in paying her
    respects to Camilla, sister of the new Pope, her former mother-in-law. The Duke
    visited Sixtus V. in state to compliment him on his elevation. But the reception
    which both received proved that Rome was no safe place for them to live in. They
    consequently made up their minds for flight.</p>
    <p>A chronic illness from which Bracciano had lately suffered furnished a sufficient
    pretext. This seems to have been something of the nature of a cancerous ulcer, which
    had to be treated by the application of raw meat to open sores. Such details are only
    excusable in the present narrative on the ground that Bracciano's disease
    considerably affects our moral judgment of the woman who could marry a man thus
    physically tainted, and with her hus<span class="pagenum"><a name="page367"
    id="page367"></a>{367}</span> band's blood upon his hands. At any rate, the Duke's
    <i>lupa</i> justified his trying what change of air, together with the sulphur waters
    of Abano, would do for him.</p>
    <p>The Duke and Duchess arrived in safety at Venice, where they had engaged the
    Dandolo palace on the Zueca. There they only stayed a few days, removing to Padua,
    where they had hired palaces of the Foscari in the Arena and a house called
    De'Cavalli. At Sal&ograve;, also, on the Lake of Garda, they provided themselves with
    fit dwellings for their princely state and their large retinues, intending to divide
    their time between the pleasures which the capital of luxury afforded and the simpler
    enjoyments of the most beautiful of the Italian lakes. But <i>la gioia dei profani
    &egrave; un fumo passaggier</i>. Paolo Giordano Orsini, Duke of Bracciano, died
    suddenly at Sal&ograve; on November 10, 1585, leaving the young and beautiful
    Vittoria helpless among enemies. What was the cause of his death? It is not possible
    to give a clear and certain answer. We have seen that he suffered from a horrible and
    voracious disease, which after his removal from Rome seems to have made progress. Yet
    though this malady may well have cut his life short, suspicion of poison was not, in
    the circumstances, quite unreasonable. The Grand Duke of Tuscany, the Pope, and the
    Orsini family were all interested in his death. Anyhow, he had time to make a will in
    Vittoria's favor, leaving her large sums of money, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page368" id="page368"></a>{368}</span> jewels, goods, and houses&mdash;enough,
    in fact, to support her ducal dignity with splendor. His hereditary fiefs and honors
    passed by right to his only son, Virginio.</p>
    <p>Vittoria, accompanied by her brother, Marcello, and the whole court of Bracciano,
    repaired at once to Padua, where she was soon after joined by Flaminio, and by the
    Prince Lodovico Orsini. Lodovico Orsini assumed the duty of settling Vittoria's
    affairs under her dead husband's will. In life he had been the duke's ally as well as
    relative. His family pride was deeply wounded by what seemed to him an ignoble, as it
    was certainly an unequal, marriage. He now showed himself the relentless enemy of the
    Duchess. Disputes arose between them as to certain details, which seem to have been
    legally decided in the widow's favor. On the night of December 22, however, forty
    men, disguised in black and fantastically tricked out to elude detection, surrounded
    her palace. Through the long galleries and chambers hung with arras, eight of them
    went, bearing torches, in search of Vittoria and her brothers. Marcello escaped,
    having fled the house under suspicion of the murder of one of his own followers.
    Flaminio, the innocent and young, was playing on his lute and singing <i>Miserere</i>
    in the great hall of the palace. The murderers surprised him with a shot from one of
    their harquebusses. He ran, wounded in the shoulder, to his sister's room. She, it is
    said, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369" id="page369"></a>{369}</span> was
    telling her beads before retiring for the night. When three of the assassins entered,
    she knelt before the crucifix, and there they stabbed her in the left breast, turning
    the poignard in the wound, and asking her with savage insults if her heart was
    pierced. Her last words were, 'Jesus, I pardon you.' Then they turned to Flaminio,
    and left him pierced with seventy-four stiletto wounds.</p>
    <p>The authorities of Padua identified the bodies of Vittoria and Flaminio, and sent
    at once for further instructions to Venice. Meanwhile it appears that both corpses
    were laid out in one open coffin for the people to contemplate. The palace and the
    church of the Eremitani, to which they had been removed, were crowded all through the
    following day with a vast concourse of the Paduans. Vittoria's dead body, pale yet
    sweet to look upon, the golden hair flowing around her marble shoulders, the red
    wound in her breast uncovered, the stately limbs arrayed in satin as she died,
    maddened the populace with its surpassing loveliness. '<i>Dentibus fremebant</i>.'
    says the chronicler, when they beheld that gracious lady stiff in death. And of a
    truth, if her corpse was actually exposed in the chapel of the Eremitani, as we have
    some right to assume, the spectacle must have been impressive. Those grim gaunt
    frescoes of Mantegna looked down on her as she lay stretched upon her bier, solemn
    and calm, and, but for pallor, beautiful as though in life. No wonder that the folk
    forgot her first husband's murder, her less <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"
    id="page370"></a>{370}</span> than comely marriage to the second. It was enough for
    them that this flower of surpassing loveliness had been cropped by villains in its
    bloom. Gathering in knots around the torches placed beside the corpse, they vowed
    vengeance against the Orsini; for suspicion, not unnaturally, fell on Prince
    Lodovico.</p>
    <p>The Prince was arrested and interrogated before the court of Padua. He entered
    their hall attended by forty armed men, responded haughtily to their questions and
    demanded free passage for his courier to Virginio Orsini, then at Florence. To this
    demand the court acceded; but the precaution of waylaying the courier and searching
    his person was very wisely taken. Besides some formal despatches which announced
    Vittoria's assassination, they found in this man's boot a compromising letter,
    declaring Virginio a party to the crime, and asserting that Lodovico had with his own
    poignard killed their victim. Padua placed itself in a state of defense, and prepared
    to besiege the palace of Prince Lodovico, who also got himself in readiness for
    battle. Engines, culverins, and fire-brands were directed against the barricades
    which he had raised. The militia was called out and the Brenta was strongly guarded.
    Meanwhile the Senate of S. Mark had despatched the Avogadore, Aloisio Bragadin, with
    full power, to the scene of action. Lodovico Orsini, it may be mentioned, was in
    their service: and had not this affair intervened, he would in a few <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>{371}</span> weeks have entered on
    his duties as Governor for Venice of Corfu.</p>
    <p>The bombardment of Orsini's palace began on Christmas Day. Three of the Prince's
    men were killed in the first assault; and since the artillery brought to bear upon
    him threatened speedy ruin to the house and its inhabitants, he made up his mind to
    surrender. 'The Prince Luigi,' writes one chronicler of these events, 'walked attired
    in brown, his poignard at his side, and his cloak slung elegantly under his arm. The
    weapon being taken from him he leaned upon a balustrade, and began to trim his nails
    with a little pair of scissors he happened to find there.'</p>
    <p>On the 27th he was strangled in prison by order of the Venetian Republic. His body
    was carried to be buried, according to his own will, in the church of S. Maria
    dell'Orto at Venice. Two of his followers were hanged next day. Fifteen were executed
    on the following Monday; two of these were quartered alive; one of them the Conte
    Paganello, who confessed to having slain Vittoria, had his left side probed with his
    own cruel dagger. Eight were condemned to the galleys, six to prison, and eleven were
    acquitted.</p>
    <p>Thus ended this terrible affair, which brought, it is said, good credit, and
    renown to the lords of Venice through all nations of the civilized world. It only
    remains to be added that Marcello Accoramboni was surrendered to the Pope's <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page372" id="page372"></a>{372}</span> vengeance and
    beheaded at Ancona, where also his mysterious accomplice, the Greek sorceress,
    perished.</p>
    <h4><i>The Duchess of Palliano</i></h4>
    <p>It was the custom of Italians in the 16th and 17th centuries to compose and
    circulate narratives of tragic or pathetic incidents in real life. They were intended
    to satisfy curiosity in an age when newspapers and law reports did not exist, and
    also to suit the taste of ladies and gentlemen versed in Boccaccio and Bandello.
    Resembling the London letters of our ancestors, they passed from hand to hand, rarely
    found their way into the printing office, and when they had performed their task were
    left to moulder in the dust of bookcases. The private archives of noble families
    abound in volumes of such tales, and some may still be found upon the shelves of
    public libraries. These MS. collections furnish a mine of inexhaustible riches to the
    student of manners. When checked by legal documents, they frequently reveal
    carelessness, inaccuracy, or even willful distortion of facts. The genius of the
    Novella, so paramount in popular Italian literature of that epoch, presided over
    their composition, adding <i>intreccio</i> to disconnected facts, heightening
    sympathy by the suggestion of romantic motives, turning the heroes or the heroines of
    their adventures into saints, and blackening the faces of the villains. Yet these
    stories, pretending to be veracious and aiming at <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page373" id="page373"></a>{373}</span> information no less than entertainment,
    present us with even a more vivid picture of customs than the Novelle. By their
    truthful touches of landscape and incident painting, by their unconscious revelation
    of contemporary sentiment in dialogue and ethical analysis of motives, they enable us
    to give form and substance to the drier details of the law-courts. One of these
    narratives I propose to condense from the transcript made by Henri Beyle, for the
    sake of the light it throws upon the tragedy of the Caraffa family.<a
    name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"
    class="fnanchor">[207]</a> It opens with an account of Paul IV.'s ascent to power and
    a description of his nephews. Don Giovanni, the eldest son of the Count of Montorio,
    was married to Violante de Cardona, sister of the Count Aliffe. Paul invested him
    with the Duchy of Palliano, which he wrested from Marc Antonio Colonna. Don Carlo,
    the second son, who had passed his life as a soldier, entered the Sacred College; and
    Don Antonio, the third, was created Marquis of Montebello. The cardinal, as prime
    minister, assumed the reins of government in Rome. The Duke of Palliano disposed of
    the Papal soldiery. The Marquis of Montebello, commanding the guard of the palace,
    excluded or admitted persons at his pleasure. Surrounded by these nephews, Paul saw
    only with their eyes, heard only what they whispered to him, and unwittingly lent his
    authority to their lawlessness. They exercised an unlimited tyranny <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>{374}</span> in Rome, laying hands
    on property and abusing their position to gratify their lusts. No woman who had the
    misfortune to please them was safe; and the cells of convents were as little
    respected as the palaces of gentlefolk. To arrive at justice was impossible; for the
    three brothers commanded all avenues, civil, ecclesiastical, and military, by which
    the Pope could be approached.</p>
    <p>Violante, Duchess of Palliano, was a young woman distinguished for her beauty no
    less than for her Spanish pride. She had received a thoroughly Italian education;
    could recite the sonnets of Petrarch and the stanzas of Ariosto by heart, and
    repeated the tales of Ser Giovanni and other novelists with an originality that lent
    new charm to their style.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Her court was a splendid one,
    frequented by noble youths and gentlewomen of the best blood in Naples. Two of these
    require particular notice: Diana Brancaccio, a relative of the Marchioness of
    Montebello; and Marcello Capecce, a young man of exceptional beauty. Diana was a
    woman of thirty years, hot-tempered, tawny-haired, devotedly in love with Domiziano
    Fornari, a squire of the Marchese di Montebello's household. Marcello had conceived
    one of those bizarre passions for the Duchess, in which an almost religious adoration
    was mingled with audacity, persistence, and aptitude for any crime. The character of
    his mistress gave him <span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"
    id="page375"></a>{375}</span> but little hope. Though profoundly wounded by her
    husband's infidelities, insulted in her pride by the presence of his wanton favorites
    under her own roof, and assailed by the importunities of the most brilliant
    profligates in Rome, she held a haughty course, above suspicion, free from taint or
    stain, Marcello could do nothing but sigh at a distance and watch his
    opportunity.</p>
    <p>At this point, the narrator seems to sacrifice historical accuracy for the sake of
    combining his chief characters in one intrigue.<a name="FNanchor_209_209"
    id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
    <p>Though he assumes the tone of a novelist rather than a chronicler, there has
    hitherto been nothing but what corresponds to fact in his description of the Caraffa
    Cabal. He now explains their downfall; and opens the subject after this fashion. At
    the beginning of the year 1559, the Pope's confessor ventured to bring before his
    notice the scandalous behavior of the Papal nephews. Paul at first refused to credit
    this report. But an incident happened which convinced him of its truth. On the feast
    of the Circumcision&mdash;a circumstance which aggravated matters in the eyes of a
    strictly pious Pontiff&mdash;Andrea Lanfranchi, secretary to the Duke of Palliano,
    invited the Cardinal Caraffa to a banquet. One of the loveliest and most notorious
    courtesans of Rome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"
    id="page376"></a>{376}</span> Martuccia, was also present; and it so happened that
    Marcello Capecce at this epoch believed he had more right to her favors than any
    other man in the capital. That night he sought her in her lodgings, pursued her up
    and down, and learned at last that she was supping with Lanfranchi and the Cardinal.
    Attended by armed men, he made his way to Lanfranchi's house, entered the banquet
    room, and ordered Martuccia to come away with him at once. The Cardinal, who was
    dressed in secular habit, rose, and, drawing his sword, protested against this
    high-handed proceeding. Martuccia, by favor of their host, was his partner that
    evening. Upon this, Marcello called his men; but when they recognized the Cardinal
    nephew, they refused to employ violence. In the course of the quarrel, Martuccia made
    her escape, followed by Marcello, Caraffa, and the company. There ensued a
    street-brawl between the young man and the Cardinal; but no blood was spilt, and the
    incident need have had but slight importance, if the Duke of Palliano had not thought
    it necessary to place Lanfranchi and Marcello under arrest. They were soon released,
    because it became evident that the chief scandal would fall upon the Cardinal, who
    had clearly been scuffling and crossing swords in a dispute about a common
    prostitute. The three Caraffa brothers resolved on hushing the affair up. But it was
    too late. The Pope heard something, which sufficed to confirm his confessor's
    warnings; and on January 27, he pronounced the famous <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page377" id="page377"></a>{377}</span> sentence on his nephews. The Cardinal
    was banished to Civit&agrave; Lavinia, the Duke to Soriano, the Marquis to
    Montebello. The Duchess took up her abode with her court in the little village of
    Gallese. It was here that the episode of her love and tragic end ensued.</p>
    <p>Violante found herself almost alone in a simple village among mountains, half-way
    between Rome and Orvieto, surrounded indeed by lovely forest scenery, but deprived of
    all the luxuries and entertainments to which she was accustomed. Marcello and Diana
    were at her side, the one eager to pursue his hitherto hopeless suit, and the other
    to further it for her own profit. One day Marcello committed the apparent imprudence
    of avowing his passion. The Duchess rejected him with scorn, but disclosed the fact
    to Diana, who calculated that if she could contrive to compromise her mistress, she
    might herself be able to secure the end she had in view of marrying Domiziano. In the
    solitude of those long days of exile the waiting-woman returned again and again to
    the subject of Marcello's devotion, his beauty, his noble blood and his manifold good
    qualities. She arranged meetings in the woods between the Duchess and her lover, and
    played her cards so well that during the course of the fine summer weeks Violante
    yielded to Marcello. Diana now judged it wise to press her own suit forward with
    Domiziano. But this cold-blooded fellow knew that he was no fit match for a relative
    of the Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>{378}</span>
    chioness of Montebello. He felt, besides, but little sentiment for his fiery
    <i>innamorata</i>. Dreading the poignard of the Caraffas, if he should presume to
    marry her, he took the prudent course of slipping away in disguise from the port of
    Nettuno. Diana maddened by disappointment, flew to the conclusion that the Duchess
    had planned her lover's removal, and resolved to take a cruel revenge. The Duke of
    Palliano was residing at Soriano, only a few miles from Gallese. To bring him secret
    information of his wife's intrigue was a matter of no difficulty. At first he refused
    to believe her report. Had not Violante resisted the seductions of all Rome, and
    repelled the advances even of the Duke of Guise? At last she contrived to introduce
    him into the bedroom of the Duchess at a moment when Marcello was also there. The
    circumstances were not precisely indicative of guilt. The sun had only just gone down
    behind the hills; a maid was in attendance; and the Duchess lay in bed, penciling
    some memoranda. Yet they were sufficient to arouse the Duke's anger. He disarmed
    Marcello and removed him to the prisons of Soriano, leaving Violante under strict
    guard at Gallese.</p>
    <p>The Duke of Palliano had no intention of proclaiming his jealousy or of suggesting
    his dishonor, until he had extracted complete proof. He therefore pretended to have
    arrested Marcello on the suspicion of an attempt to poison him. Some large toads,
    bought by the young man at a high price two or <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page379" id="page379"></a>{379}</span> three months earlier, lent color to this
    accusation. Meanwhile the investigation was conducted as secretly as possible by the
    Duke in person, his brother-in-law Count Aliffe, and a certain Antonio Torando, with
    the sanction of the Podest&agrave; of Soriano. After examining several witnesses,
    they became convinced of Violante's guilt. Marcello was put to the torture, and
    eventually confessed. The Duke stabbed him to death with his own hands, and
    afterwards cut Diana's throat for her share in the business. Both bodies were thrown
    into the prison-sewer. Meanwhile Paul IV. had retained the young Cardinal, Alfonso
    Caraffa, son of the Marquis of Montebello, near his person. This prelate thought it
    right to inform his grand-uncle of the occurrences at Soriano. The Pope only
    answered: 'And the Duchess? What have they done with her?' Paul IV. died in August,
    and the Conclave, which ended in the election of Pius IV., was opened. During the
    important intrigues of that moment, Cardinal Alfonso found time to write to the Duke,
    imploring him not to leave so dark a stain upon his honor, but to exercise justice on
    a guilty wife. On August 28, 1559, the Duke sent the Count Aliffe, and Don Leonardo
    del Cardine, with a company of soldiers to Gallese. They told Violante that they had
    arrived to kill her, and offered her the offices of two Franciscan monks. Before her
    death, the Duchess repeatedly insisted on her innocence, and received the Sacrament
    from the hands of Friar Antonio of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page380"
    id="page380"></a>{380}</span> Pavia. The Count, her brother, then proceeded to her
    execution. She covered her eyes with a handkerchief, which she, with perfect <i>sang
    froid</i>, drew somewhat lower in order to shut his sight out. Then he adjusted the
    cord to her neck; but, finding that it would not exactly fit, he removed it and
    walked away. The Duchess raised the bandage from her face, and said: "Well! what are
    we about then?" He answered: "The cord was not quite right, and I am going to get
    another, in order that you may not suffer." When he returned to the room, he arranged
    the handkerchief again, fixed the cord, turned the wand in the knot behind her neck,
    and strangled her. The whole incident, on the part of the Duchess, passed in the tone
    of ordinary conversation. She died like a good Christian, frequently repeating the
    words <i>Credo, Credo</i>.</p>
    <p>Contrary to the usual custom and opinion of the age, this murder of an erring wife
    and sister formed part of the accusations brought against the Duke of Palliano and
    Count Aliffe. It will be remembered that they were executed in Rome, together with
    the elder Cardinal Caraffa, during the pontificate of Pius IV.</p>
    <h4><i>Wife-Murders</i></h4>
    <p>It would be difficult to give any adequate notion of the frequency of wife-murders
    at this epoch in the higher ranks of society. I will, however, mention a few, noticed
    by me in the course of study. Donna<span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"
    id="page381"></a>{381}</span> Pellegrina, daughter of Bianca Capello before her
    marriage with the Grand Duke of Tuscany, was killed at Bologna in 1598 by four masked
    assassins at the order of her husband, Count Ulisse Bentivoglio. She had been
    suspected or convicted of adultery; and the Court of Florence sent word to the Count,
    'che essendo vero quanto scriveva, facesse quello che conveniva a cavaliere di
    honore.' In the light of open day, together with two of her gentlewomen and her
    coachman, she was cut to pieces and left on the road.<a name="FNanchor_210_210"
    id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> In
    1690 at Naples Don Carlo Gesualdo, son of the Prince of Venosta, assassinated his
    wife and cousin Donna Maria d'Avalos, together with her lover, Fabricio Caraffa, Duke
    of Andri. This crime was committed in his palace by the husband, attended by a band
    of cut-throats.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In 1577, at Milan, Count Giovanni
    Borromeo, cousin of the Cardinal Federigo, stabbed his wife, the Countess Giulia
    Sanseverina, sister of the Contessa di Sala, at table, with three mortal wounds. A
    mere domestic squabble gave rise to this tragedy.<a name="FNanchor_212_212"
    id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> In
    1598, in his villa of Zenzalino at Ferrara, the Count Ercole Trotti, with the
    assistance of a bravo called Jacopo Lazzarini, killed his wife Anna, daughter of the
    poet Guarini. Her own brother Girolamo connived at the act and helped to facilitate
    its execution. She was accused&mdash;falsely, as it afterwards appeared from
    Girolamo's confession&mdash;of an improper intimacy with <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page382" id="page382"></a>{382}</span> the Count Ercole Bevilacqua. I may add
    that Count Ercole Trotti's father, Alfonso, had murdered his own wife, Michela
    Granzena, in the same villa.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>
    <h4><i>The Medici</i></h4>
    <p>The history of the Medicean family during the sixteenth century epitomizes the
    chief features of social morality upon which I have been dwelling in this chapter. It
    will be remembered that Alessandro de' Medici, the first Duke of Florence, poisoned
    his cousin Ippolito, and was himself assassinated by his cousin Lorenzino. To the
    second of these crimes Cosimo, afterwards Grand Duke of Tuscany, owed the throne of
    Florence, on which, however, he was not secure until he had removed Lorenzino from
    this world by the poignard of a bravo. Cosimo maintained his authority by a system of
    espionage, remorseless persecution, and assassination, which gave color even to the
    most improbable of legends.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
    <p>But it is not of him so much as of his children that I have to speak. Francesco,
    who reigned from 1564 till 1587, brought disgrace upon his line by marrying the
    infamous Bianca Capello, after authorizing the murder of her previous husband.
    Bianca, though incapable of bearing children, flattered her besotted <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page383" id="page383"></a>{383}</span> paramour before this
    marriage by pretending to have borne a son. In reality, she had secured the
    co-operation of three women on the point of child-birth; and when one of these was
    delivered of a boy, she presented this infant to Francesco, who christened him
    Antonio de'Medici. Of the three mothers who served in this nefarious transaction,
    Bianca contrived to assassinate two, but not before one of the victims to her dread
    of exposure made full confession at the point of death. The third escaped. Another
    woman who had superintended the affair was shot between Florence and Bologna in the
    valleys of the Apennines. Yet after the manifestation of Bianca's imposture, the Duke
    continued to recognize Antonio as belonging to the Medicean family; and his successor
    was obliged to compel this young man to assume the Cross of Malta, in order to
    exclude his posterity from the line of princes.<a name="FNanchor_215_215"
    id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>
    <p>The legend of Francesco's and Bianca's mysterious death is well known. The Duchess
    had engaged in fresh intrigues for palming off a spurious child upon her husband.
    These roused the suspicions of his brother Cardinal Ferdinando de'Medici, heir
    presumptive to the crown. An angry correspondence followed, ending in a
    reconciliation between the three princes. They met in the autumn of 1587 at the villa
    of Poggio a Cajano. Then the world was startled by the announcement that the Grand
    Duke had died of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page384"
    id="page384"></a>{384}</span> fever after a few days' illness, and that Bianca had
    almost immediately afterwards followed him to the grave. Ferdinand, on succeeding to
    the throne, refused her the interment suited to her rank, defaced her arms on public
    edifices, and for her name and titles in official documents substituted the words,
    'la pessima Bianca.' What passed at Poggio a Cajano is not known. It was commonly
    believed in Italy that Bianca, meaning to poison the Cardinal at supper, had been
    frustrated in her designs by a blunder which made her husband the victim of this
    plot, and that she ended her own life in despair or fell a victim to the Cardinal's
    vengeance. This story is rejected both by Botta and Galluzzi; but Litta has given it
    a partial credence.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Two of Cosimo's sons died
    previously, in the year 1562, under circumstances which gave rise to similar
    malignant rumors. Don Garzia and the Cardinal Giovanni were hunting together in the
    Pisan marshes, when the latter expired after a short illness, and the former in a few
    days met with a like fate. Report ran that Don Garzia had stabbed his brother, and
    that Cosimo, in a fit of rage, ran him through the body with his own sword. In this
    case, although Litta attaches weight to the legend, the balance of evidence is
    strongly in favor of both brothers having been carried off by a pernicious fever
    contracted simultaneously during <span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"
    id="page385"></a>{385}</span> their hunting expedition.<a name="FNanchor_217_217"
    id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Each
    instance serves however, to show in what an atmosphere of guilt the Medicean princes
    were enveloped. No one believed that they could die except by fraternal or paternal
    hands. And the authentic crimes of the family certainly justified this popular
    belief. I have already alluded to the murders of Ippolito, Alessandro, and Lorenzino.
    I have told how the Court of Florence sanctioned the assassination of Bianca's
    daughter by her husband at Bologna.<a name="FNanchor_218_218"
    id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> I
    must now proceed to relate the tragic tales of the princesses of the house.</p>
    <p>Pietro de'Medici, a fifth of Cosimo's sons, had rendered himself notorious in
    Spain and Italy by forming a secret society for the most revolting debaucheries.<a
    name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219"
    class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Yet he married the noble lady Eleonora di Toledo, related
    by blood to Cosimo's first wife. Neglected and outraged by her husband, she proved
    unfaithful, and Pietro hewed her in pieces with his own hands at Caffaggiolo.
    Isabella de'Medici, daughter of Cosimo, was married to the Duke of Bracciano.
    Educated in the empoisoned atmosphere of Florence, she, like Eleonora di Toledo,
    yielded herself to fashionable profligacy, and was strangled by her husband at
    Cerretto.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a><span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page386" id="page386"></a>{386}</span></p>
    <p>Both of these murders took place in 1576. Isabella's death, as I have elsewhere
    related, opened the way for the Duke of Bracciano's marriage with Vittoria
    Accoramboni, which had been prepared by the assassination of her first husband, and
    which led to her own murder at Padua.<a name="FNanchor_221_221"
    id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
    Another of Cosimo's daughters, Lucrezia de'Medici, became Duchess of Ferrara, fell
    under a suspicion of infidelity, and was possibly removed by poison in 1561.<a
    name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222"
    class="fnanchor">[222]</a> The last of his sons whom I have to mention, Don Giovanni,
    married a dissolute woman of low birth called Livia, and disgraced the name of Medici
    by the unprincely follies of his life. Eleonora de'Medici, third of his daughters,
    introduces a comic element into these funereal records. She was affianced to Vincenzo
    Gonzaga, heir of the Duchy of Mantua. But suspicions, arising out of the
    circumstances of his divorce from a former wife, obliged him to prove his marital
    capacity before the completion of the contract. This he did at Venice, before a
    witness, upon the person of a virgin selected for the experiment.<a
    name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223"
    class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Maria de'Medici, the only child of Duke Francesco, became
    Queen of France. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"
    id="page387"></a>{387}</span> The history of her amours with Concini forms an episode
    in French annals.</p>
    <p>If now we eliminate the deaths of Don Garcia, Cardinal Giovanni, Duke Francesco,
    Bianca Capello, and Lucrezia de'Medici, as doubtful, there will still remain the
    murders of Cardinal Ippolito, Duke Alessandro, Lorenzino de'Medici, Pietro
    Bonaventuri (Bianca's husband), Pellegrina Bentivoglio (Bianca's daughter), Eleonora
    di Toledo, Francesco Casi (Eleonora's lover), the Duchess of Bracciano, Troilo Orsini
    (lover of this Duchess), Felice Peretti (husband of Vittoria Accoramboni), and

    </div>
    <p>The stories related in the foregoing chapter abundantly demonstrate the close
    connection between the aristocracy and their accomplices&mdash;bravos and bandits.
    But it still remains to consider this connection from the professional murderer's own
    point of view. And for this purpose, I will now make use of two documents vividly
    illustrative of the habits, sentiments, and social status of men who undertook to
    speculate in bloodshed for reward. They are both autobiographical; and both relate
    tragedies which occupied the attention of all Italy.</p>
    <h4><i>Cecco Bibboni</i></h4>
    <p>The first of these documents is the report made by Cecco Bibboni concerning his
    method adopted for the murder of Lorenzino de'Medici at Venice in 1546. Lorenzino, by
    the help of a bravo called Scoroncolo, had assassinated his cousin Alessandro, Duke
    of Florence, in 1537. After accomplishing <span class="pagenum"><a name="page389"
    id="page389"></a>{389}</span> this deed, which gained for him the name of Brutus, he
    escaped from the city; and a distant relative of the murdered and the murderer,
    Cosimo de'Medici, was chosen Duke in Alessandro's stead. One of the first acts of his
    reign was to publish a ban of outlawry against Lorenzino. His portrait was painted
    according to old Tuscan usage head downwards, and suspended by one foot, upon the
    wall of Alessandro's fortress. His house was cut in twain from roof to pavement, and
    a narrow passage was driven through it, which received the name of Traitor's Alley,
    <i>Chiasso del Traditore</i>. The price put upon his head was enormous&mdash;four
    thousand golden florins, with a pension of one hundred florins to the murderer and
    his heirs in perpetuity. The man who should kill Lorenzino was, further, to enjoy
    amnesty from all offenses and to exercise full civic rights; he was promised
    exemption from taxes, the privilege of carrying arms with two attendants in the whole
    domain of Florence, and the prerogative of restoring ten outlaws at his choice. If he
    captured Lorenzino and brought him alive to Florence, the reward would be double in
    each item. There was enough here to raise cupidity and stir the speculative spirit.
    Cecco Bibboni shall tell us how the business was brought to a successful
    termination.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>
    <p>'When I returned from Germany,' begins Bibboni,<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page390" id="page390"></a>{390}</span> 'where I had been in the pay of the
    Emperor, I found at Vicenza Bebo da Volterra, who was staying in the house of M.
    Antonio da Roma, a nobleman of that city. This gentleman employed him because of a
    great feud he had; and he was mighty pleased, moreover, at my coming, and desired
    that I too should take up my quarters in his palace.'</p>
    <p>Bibboni proceeds to say how another gentleman of Vicenza, M. Francesco Manente,
    had at this time a feud with certain of the Guazzi and the Laschi, which had lasted
    several years, and cost the lives of many members of both parties and their
    following. M. Francesco, being a friend of M. Antonio, besought that gentleman to
    lend him Bibboni and Bebo for a season; and the two <i>bravi</i> went together with
    their new master to Celsano, a village in the neighborhood. 'There both parties had
    estates, and all of them kept armed men in their houses, so that not a day passed
    without feats of arms, and always there was some one killed or wounded. One day, soon
    afterwards, the leaders of our party resolved to attack the foe in their house, where
    we killed two, and the rest, numbering five men, entrenched themselves in a
    ground-floor apartment; whereupon we took possession of their harquebusses and other
    arms, which forced them to abandon the villa and retire to Vicenza; and within a
    short space of time this great feud was terminated by an ample peace.' After this
    Bebo took service with the Rector of the University in Padua, and was transferred by
    his new <span class="pagenum"><a name="page391" id="page391"></a>{391}</span> patron
    to Milan. Bibboni remained at Vicenza with M. Galeazzo della Seta, who stood in great
    fear of his life, notwithstanding the peace which had been concluded between the two
    factions. At the end of ten months he returned to M. Antonio da Roma and his six
    brothers, 'all of whom being very much attached to me, they proposed that I should
    live my life with them, for good or ill, and be treated as one of the family; upon
    the understanding that if war broke out and I wanted to take part in it, I should
    always have twenty-five crowns and arms and horse, with welcome home, so long as I
    lived; and in case I did not care to join the troops, the same provision for my
    maintenance.'</p>
    <p>From these details we comprehend the sort of calling which a bravo of Bibboni's
    species followed. Meanwhile Bebo was at Milan. 'There it happened that M. Francesco
    Vinta, of Volterra, was on embassy from the Duke of Florence. He saw Bebo, and asked
    him what he was doing in Milan, and Bebo answered that he was a knight errant.' This
    phrase&mdash;derived, no doubt, from the romantic epics then in vogue&mdash;was a
    pretty euphemism for a rogue of Bebo's quality. The ambassador now began cautiously
    to sound his man, who seems to have been outlawed from the Tuscan duchy, telling him
    he knew a way by which he might return with favor to his home, and at last disclosing
    the affair of Lorenzino. Bebo was puzzled at first, but when he understood the
    matter, he professed his willingness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"
    id="page392"></a>{392}</span> took letters from the envoy to the Duke of Florence,
    and, in a private audience with Cosimo, informed him that he was ready to attempt
    Lorenzino's assassination. He added that 'he had a comrade fit for such a job, whose
    fellow for the business could not easily be found.'</p>
    <p>Bebo now traveled to Vicenza, and opened the whole matter to Bibboni, who weighed
    it well, and at last, being convinced that the Duke's commission to his comrade was
    <i>bon&acirc; fide</i>, determined to take his share in the undertaking. The two
    agreed to have no accomplices. They went to Venice, and 'I,' says Bibboni, 'being
    most intimately acquainted with all that city, and provided there with many friends,
    soon quietly contrived to know where Lorenzino lodged, and took a room in the
    neighborhood, and spent some days in seeing how we best might rule our conduct.'
    Bibboni soon discovered that Lorenzino never left his palace; and he therefore
    remained in much perplexity, until, by good luck, Ruberto Strozzi arrived from France
    in Venice, bringing in his train a Navarrese servant, who had the nickname of
    Spagnoletto. This fellow was a great friend of the bravo. They met, and Bibboni told
    him that he should like to go and kiss the hands of Messer Ruberto, whom he had known
    in Rome. Strozzi inhabited the same palace as Lorenzino. 'When we arrived there, both
    Messer Ruberto and Lorenzino were leaving the house, and there were around them so
    many gentlemen and other persons, that I could <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page393" id="page393"></a>{393}</span> not present myself, and both straightway
    stepped into the gondola. Then I, not having seen Lorenzino for a long while past,
    and because he was very quietly attired, could not recognize the man exactly, but
    only as it were between certainty and doubt. Wherefore I said to Spagnoletto, "I
    think I know that gentleman, but don't remember where I saw him." And Messer Ruberto
    was giving him his right hand. Then Spagnoletto answered, "You know him well enough;
    he is Messer Lorenzino. But see you tell this to nobody. He goes by the name of
    Messer Dario, because he lives in great fear for his safety, and people don't know
    that he is now in Venice." I answered that I marveled much, and if I could have
    helped him, would have done so willingly. Then I asked where they were going, and he
    said, to dine with Messer Giovanni della Casa, who was the Pope's Legate. I did not
    leave the man till I had drawn from him all I required.'</p>
    <p>Thus spoke the Italian Judas. The appearance of La Casa on the scene is
    interesting. He was the celebrated author of the <i>Capitolo del Forno</i>, the
    author of many sublime and melancholy sonnets, who was now at Venice prosecuting a
    charge of heresy against Pier Paolo Vergerio, and paying his addresses to a noble
    lady of the Quirini family. It seems that on the territory of San Marco he made
    common cause with the exiles from Florence, for he was himself by birth a Florentine,
    and he had no objection to take Brutus-Lorenzino by the hand.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>{394}</span> After the
    noblemen had rowed off in their gondola to dine with the Legate, Bibboni and his
    friend entered their palace, where he found another old acquaintance, the
    house-steward, or <i>spenditore</i> of Lorenzino. From him he gathered much useful
    information. Pietro Strozzi, it seems, had allowed the tyrannicide one thousand five
    hundred crowns a year, with the keep of three brave and daring companions (<i>tre
    compagni bravi e facinorosi</i>), and a palace worth fifty crowns on lease. But
    Lorenzino had just taken another on the Campo di San Polo at three hundred crowns a
    year, for which swagger (<i>altura</i>) Pietro Strozzi had struck a thousand crowns
    off his allowance. Bibboni also learned that he was keeping house with his uncle,
    Alessandro Soderini, another Florentine outlaw, and that he was ardently in love with
    a certain beautiful Barozza. This woman was apparently one of the grand courtesans of
    Venice. He further ascertained the date when he was going to move into the palace at
    San Polo, and, 'to put it briefly, knew everything he did, and, as it were, how many
    times a day he spit.' Such were the intelligences of the servants' hall, and of such
    value were they to men of Bibboni's calling.</p>
    <p>In the Carnival of 1546 Lorenzino meant to go masqued in the habit of a gypsy
    woman to the square of San Spirito, where there was to be a joust. Great crowds of
    people would assemble, and Bibboni hoped to do his business there. The assassination,
    however, failed on this occasion, and Lorenzino took <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page395" id="page395"></a>{395}</span> up his abode in the palace he had hired
    upon the Campo di San Polo. This Campo is one of the largest open places in Venice,
    shaped irregularly, with a finely curving line upon the western side, where two of
    the noblest private houses in the city are still standing. Nearly opposite these, in
    the south-western angle, stands, detached, the little old church of San Polo. One of
    its side entrances opens upon the square; the other on a lane which leads eventually
    to the Frari. There is nothing in Bibboni's narrative to make it clear where
    Lorenzino hired his dwelling. But it would seem from certain things which he says
    later on, that in order to enter the church his victim had to cross the square.
    Meanwhile Bibboni took the precaution of making friends with a shoemaker, whose shop
    commanded the whole Campo, including Lorenzino's palace. In this shop he began to
    spend much of his time; 'and oftentimes I feigned to be asleep; but God knows whether
    I was sleeping, for my mind, at any rate, was wide awake.'</p>
    <p>A second convenient occasion for murdering Lorenzino soon seemed to offer. He was
    bidden to dine with Monsignor della Casa; and Bibboni, putting a bold face on,
    entered the Legate's palace, having left Bebo below in the loggia, fully resolved to
    do the business. 'But we found,' he says, 'that they had gone to dine at Murano, so
    that we remained with our tabors in their bag.' The island of Murano at that period
    was a favorite resort of the Venetian <span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"
    id="page396"></a>{396}</span> nobles, especially of the more literary and artistic,
    who kept country-houses there, where they enjoyed the fresh air of the lagoons and
    the quiet of their gardens.</p>
    <p>The third occasion, after all these weeks of watching, brought success to
    Bibboni's schemes. He had observed how Lorenzino occasionally so far broke his rules
    of caution as to go on foot, past the church of San Polo, to visit the beautiful
    Barozza; and he resolved, if possible, to catch him on one of these journeys. 'It so
    chanced on February 28, which was the second Sunday of Lent, that having gone, as was
    my wont, to pry out whether Lorenzino would give orders for going abroad that day, I
    entered the shoemaker's shop, and stayed awhile, until Lorenzino came to the window
    with a napkin round his neck&mdash;for he was combing his hair &mdash;and at the same
    moment I saw a certain Giovan Battista Martelli, who kept his sword for the defense
    of Lorenzino's person, enter and come forth again. Concluding that they would
    probably go abroad, I went home to get ready and procure the necessary weapons, and
    there I found Bebo asleep in bed, and made him get up at once, and we came to our
    accustomed post of observation, by the church of San Polo, where our men would have
    to pass.' Bibboni now retired to his friend the shoemaker's, and Bebo took up his
    station at one of the side doors of San Polo: 'and, as good luck would have it,
    Giovan Battista Martelli came forth, and walked a piece in front, and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page397" id="page397"></a>{397}</span> then Lorenzino came,
    and then Alessandro Soderini, going the one behind the other, like storks, and
    Lorenzino, on entering the church, and lifting up the curtain of the door, was seen
    from the opposite door by Bebo, who at the same time noticed how I had left the shop,
    and so we met upon the street as we had agreed, and he told me that Lorenzino was
    inside the church.'</p>
    <p>To any one who knows the Campo di San Polo, it will be apparent that Lorenzino had
    crossed from the western side of the piazza and entered the church by what is
    technically called its northern door. Bebo, stationed at the southern door, could see
    him when he pushed the heavy <i>stoia</i> or leather curtain aside, and at the same
    time could observe Bibboni's movements in the cobbler's shop. Meanwhile Lorenzino
    walked across the church and came to the same door where Bebo had been standing. 'I
    saw him issue from the church and take the main street; then came Alessandro
    Soderini, and I walked last of all; and when we reached the point we had determined
    on, I jumped in front of Alessandro with the poignard in my hand, crying, "Hold hard,
    Alessandro, and get along with you, in God's name, for we are not here for you!" He
    then threw himself around my waist, and grasped my arms, and kept on calling out.
    Seeing how wrong I had been to try to spare his life, I wrenched myself as well as I
    could from his grip, and with my lifted poignard struck him, as God willed, above the
    eyebrow, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>{398}</span> a
    little blood trickled from the wound. He, in high fury, gave me such a thrust that I
    fell backward, and the ground besides was slippery from having rained a little. Then
    Alessandro drew his sword, which he carried in its scabbard, and thrust at me in
    front, and struck me on the corselet, which for my good fortune was of double mail.
    Before I could get ready I received three passes, which, had I worn a doublet instead
    of that mailed corselet, would certainly have run me through. At the fourth pass I
    had regained my strength and spirit, and closed with him, and stabbed him four times
    in the head, and being so close he could not use his sword, but tried to parry with
    his hand and hilt, and I, as God willed, struck him at the wrist below the sleeve of
    mail, and cut his hand off clean, and gave him then one last stroke on his head.
    Thereupon he begged for God's sake spare his life, and I, in trouble about Bebo, left
    him in the arms of a Venetian nobleman, who held him back from jumping into the
    canal.'</p>
    <p>Who this Venetian nobleman, found unexpectedly upon the scene, was, does not
    appear. Nor, what is still more curious, do we hear anything of that Martelli, the
    bravo, 'who kept his sword for the defense of Lorenzino's person.' The one had
    arrived accidentally, it seems. The other must have been a coward and escaped from
    the scuffle.</p>
    <p>'When I turned,' proceeds Bibboni, 'I found Lorenzino on his knees. He raised
    himself, and I in anger, gave him a great cut across the head, which <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>{399}</span> split it in two
    pieces, and laid him at my feet, and he never rose again.'</p>
    <p>Bebo, meanwhile, had made off from the scene of action. And Bibboni, taking to his
    heels, came up with him in the little square of San Marcello. They now ran for their
    lives till they reached the traghetto di San Spirito, where they threw their
    poignards into the water, remembering that no man might carry these in Venice under
    penalty of the galleys. Bibboni's white hose were drenched with blood. He therefore
    agreed to separate from Bebo, having named a rendezvous. Left alone, his ill luck
    brought him face to face with twenty constables (<i>sbirri</i>). 'In a moment I
    conceived that they knew everything, and were come to capture me, and of a truth I
    saw that it was over with me. As swiftly as I could I quickened pace and got into a
    church, near to which was the house of a Compagnia, and the one opened into the
    other, and knelt down and prayed commending myself with fervor to God for my
    deliverance and safety. Yet while I prayed, I kept my eyes well opened and saw the
    whole band pass the church, except one man who entered, and I strained my sight so
    that I seemed to see behind as well as in front, and then it was I longed for my
    poignard, for I should not have heeded being in a church.' But the constable, it soon
    appeared, was not looking for Bibboni. So he gathered up his courage, and ran for the
    Church of San Spirito, where the Padre Andrea Volterrano was preaching to a great
    congre<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>{400}</span> gation.
    He hoped to go in by one door and out by the other, but the crowd prevented him, and
    he had to turn back and face the <i>sbirri</i>. One of them followed him, having
    probably caught sight of the blood upon his hose. Then Bibboni resolved to have done
    with the fellow, and rushed at him, and flung him down with his head upon the
    pavement, and ran like mad, and came at last, all out of breath to San Marco.</p>
    <p>It seems clear that before Bibboni separated from Bebo they had crossed the water,
    for the Sestiere di San Polo is separated from the Sestiere di San Marco by the Grand
    Canal. And this they must have done at the traghetto di San Spirito. Neither the
    church nor the traghetto are now in existence, and this part of the story is
    therefore obscure.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>
    <p>Having reached San Marco, he took a gondola at the Ponte della Paglia, where
    tourists are now wont to stand and contemplate the Ducal Palace and the Bridge of
    Sighs. First, he sought the house of a woman of the town who was his friend; then
    changed purpose, and rowed to the palace of the Count Salici da Collalto. 'He was a
    great friend and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page401"
    id="page401"></a>{401}</span> intimate of ours, because Bebo and I had done him many
    and great services in times past. There I knocked; and Bebo opened the door, and when
    he saw me dabbled with blood, he marveled that I had not come to grief and fallen
    into the hands of justice; and, indeed, had feared as much because I had remained so
    long away.' It appears, therefore, that the Palazzo Collalto was their rendezvous.
    'The Count was from home; but being known to all his people, I played the master and
    went into the kitchen to the fire, and with soap and water turned my hose, which had
    been white, to a grey color.' This is a very delicate way of saying that he washed
    out the blood of Alessandro and Lorenzino!</p>
    <p>Soon after the Count returned, and 'lavished caresses' upon Bebo and his precious
    comrade. They did not tell him what they had achieved that morning, but put him off
    with a story of having settled a <i>sbirro</i> in a quarrel about a girl. Then the
    Count invited them to dinner; and being himself bound to entertain the first
    physician of Venice, requested them to take it in an upper chamber. He and his
    secretary served them with their own hands at table. When the physician arrived, the
    Count went downstairs; and at this moment a messenger came from Lorenzino's mother,
    begging the doctor to go at once to San Polo, for that her son had been murdered and
    Soderini wounded to the death. It was now no longer possible to conceal their doings
    from the Count, who told them to pluck up courage and abide <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page402" id="page402"></a>{402}</span> in patience. He had himself to dine and
    take his siesta, and then to attend a meeting of the Council.</p>
    <p>About the hour of vespers, Bibboni determined to seek better refuge. Followed at a
    discreet distance by Bebo, he first called at their lodgings and ordered supper. Two
    priests came in and fell into conversation with them. But something in the behavior
    of one of these good men roused his suspicions. So they left the house, took a
    gondola, and told the man to row hard to S. Maria Zobenigo. On the way he bade him
    put them on shore, paid him well, and ordered him to wait for them. They landed near
    the palace of the Spanish embassy; and here Bibboni meant to seek sanctuary. For it
    must be remembered that the houses of ambassadors, no less than those of princes of
    the Church, were inviolable. They offered the most convenient harboring-places to
    rascals. Charles V., moreover, was deeply interested in the vengeance taken on
    Alessandro de'Medici's murderer, for his own natural daughter was Alessandro's widow
    and Duchess of Florence. In the palace they were received with much courtesy by about
    forty Spaniards, who showed considerable curiosity, and told them that Lorenzino and
    Alessandro Soderini had been murdered that morning by two men whose description
    answered to their appearance. Bibboni put their questions by and asked to see the
    ambassador. He was not at home. 'In that case,' said Bibboni, 'take us to the
    secretary. Attended by some thirty Spaniards, 'with great joy <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>{403}</span> and gladness,' they
    were shown into the secretary's chamber. He sent the rest of the folk away, 'and
    locked the door well, and then embraced and kissed us before we had said a word, and
    afterwards bade us talk freely without any fear.' When Bibboni had told the whole
    story, he was again embraced and kissed by the secretary, who thereupon left them and
    went to the private apartment of the ambassador. Shortly after he returned and led
    them by a winding staircase into the presence of his master. The ambassador greeted
    them with great honor, told them he would strain all the power of the empire to hand
    them in safety over to Duke Cosimo, and that he had already sent a courier to the
    Emperor with the good news.</p>
    <p>So they remained in hiding in the Spanish embassy; and in ten days' time commands
    were received from Charles himself that everything should be done to convey them
    safely to Florence. The difficulty was how to smuggle them out of Venice, where the
    police of the Republic were on watch, and Florentine outlaws were mounting guard on
    sea and shore to catch them. The ambassador began by spreading reports on the Rialto
    every morning of their having been seen at Padua, at Verona, in Friuli. He then hired
    a palace at Malghera, near Mestre, and went out daily with fifty Spaniards, and took
    carriage or amused himself with horse exercise and shooting. The Florentines, who
    were on watch, could only discover from his people that he did this <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>{404}</span> for amusement. When
    he thought that he had put them sufficiently off their guard, the ambassador one day
    took Bibboni and Bebo out by Canaregio to Malghera, concealed in his own gondola,
    with the whole train of Spaniards in attendance. And though on landing, the
    Florentines challenged them, they durst not interfere with an ambassador or come to
    battle with his men. So Bebo and Bibboni were hustled into a coach, and afterwards
    provided with two comrades and four horses. They rode for ninety miles without
    stopping to sleep, and on the day following this long journey reached Trento, having
    probably threaded the mountain valleys above Bassano, for Bibboni speaks of a certain
    village where the people talked half German. The Imperial Ambassador at Trento
    forwarded them next day to Mantua; from Mantua they came to Piacenza; thence passing
    through the valley of the Taro, crossing the Apennines at Cisa, descending on
    Pontremoli, and reaching Pisa at night, the fourteenth day after their escape from
    Venice.</p>
    <p>When they arrived at Pisa, Duke Cosimo was supping. So they went to an inn, and
    next morning presented themselves to his Grace. Cosimo welcomed them kindly, assured
    them of his gratitude, confirmed them in the enjoyment of their rewards and
    privileges, and swore that they might rest secure of his protection in all parts of
    his dominion. We may imagine how the men caroused together after this reception. As
    Bibboni adds, 'We were now able <span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"
    id="page405"></a>{405}</span> for the whole time of life left us to live splendidly,
    without a thought or care.' The last words of his narrative are these: 'Bebo, from
    Pisa, at what date I know not, went home to Volterra, his native town, and there
    finished his days; while I abode in Florence, where I have had no further wish to
    hear of wars, but to live my life in holy peace.'</p>
    <p>So ends the story of the two <i>bravi</i>. We have reason to believe, from some
    contemporary documents which Cant&ugrave; has brought to light, that Bibboni
    exaggerated his own part in the affair. Luca Martelli, writing to Varchi, says that
    it was Bebo who clove Lorenzino's skull with a cutlass. He adds this curious detail,
    that the weapons of both men were poisoned, and that the wound inflicted by Bibboni
    on Soderini's hand was a slight one. Yet, the poignard being poisoned, Soderini died
    of it. In other respects Martelli's brief account agrees with that given by Bibboni,
    who probably did no more, his comrade being dead, than claim for himself, at some
    expense of truth, the lion's share of their heroic action.</p>
    <h4><i>Ambrogio Tremazzi</i><a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></h4>
    <p>In illustration of this narrative, and in evidence that it stands by no means
    solitary on the records of that century, I shall extract some passages from the
    report made by Ambrogio Tremazzi of Modigliana <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page406" id="page406"></a>{406}</span> concerning the assassination of Troilo
    Orsini. Troilo it will be remembered, was the lover of the Medicean Duchess of
    Bracciano. After the discovery of their amours, and while the lady was being
    strangled by her husband, with the sanction of her brother Troilo escaped to France.
    Ambrogio Tremazzi knowing that his murder would be acceptable to the Medici,
    undertook the adventure; moved, as he says, 'solely by the desire of bringing myself
    into favorable notice with the Grand Duke; for my mind revolted at the thought of
    money payments, and I had in view the acquisition of honor and praise rather, being
    willing to risk my life for the credit of my Prince, and not my life only, but also
    to incur deadly and perpetual feud with a powerful branch of the Orsini family.' On
    his return from France, having successfully accomplished the mission, Ambrogio
    Tremazzi found that the friends who had previously encouraged his hopes, especially
    the Count Ridolfo Isolami, wished to compromise his reward by the settlement of a
    pension on himself and his associate. Whether he really aimed at a more honorable
    recognition of his services, or whether he sought to obtain better pecuniary terms,
    does not appear. But he represents himself as gravely insulted; 'seeing that my tenor
    of life from boyhood upwards has been always honorable, and thus it ever shall be.'
    After this exordium in the form of a letter addressed to one Signor Antonio
    [Serguidi], he proceeds to render account of his <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page407" id="page407"></a>{407}</span> proceedings. It seems that Don Piero
    de'Medici gave him three hundred crowns for his traveling expenses; after which,
    leaving his son, a boy of twelve years, as hostage in the service of Piero, he set
    off and reached Paris on August 12, 1577. There he took lodgings at the sign of the
    Red Horse, near the Cordeilliers, and began at once to make inquiries for Troilo. He
    had brought with him from Italy a man called Hieronimo Savorano. Their joint
    investigations elicited the fact that Troilo had been lately wounded in the service
    of the King of France, and was expected to arrive in Paris with the Court. It was not
    until the eve of All Saints' day that the Court returned. Soon afterwards, Ambrogio
    was talking at the door of a house with some Italian comedians, when a young man,
    covered with a tawny-colored mantle, passed by upon a brown horse, bearing a servant
    behind him on the crupper. This was Troilo Orsini; and Ambrogio marked him well.
    Troilo, after some minutes' conversation with the players, rode forward to the
    Louvre. The <i>bravo</i> followed him and discovered from his servant where he
    lodged. Accordingly, he engaged rooms in the Rue S. Honor&eacute;, in order to be
    nearer to his victim.</p>
    <p>Some time, however, elapsed before he was able to ascertain Troilo's daily habits.
    Chance at last threw them together. He was playing <i>primiero</i> one evening in the
    house of an actress called Vittoria, when Troilo entered, with two gentlemen of
    Florence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>{408}</span> He
    said he had been absent ten days from Paris. Ambrogio, who had left his harquebuss at
    home, not expecting to meet him, 'was consequently on that occasion unable to do
    anything.' Days passed without a better opportunity, till, on November 30, 'the feast
    of S. Andrew, which is a lucky day for me, I rose and went at once to the palace,
    and, immediately on my arrival, saw him at the hour when the king goes forth to
    mass.' Ambrogio had to return as he went; for Troilo was surrounded by too many
    gentlemen of the French Court; but he made his mind up then and there 'to see the end
    of him or me.' He called his comrade Hieronimo, posted him on a bridge across the
    Seine, and proceeded to the Court, where Troilo was now playing racquets with princes
    of the royal family. Ambrogio hung about the gates until Troilo issued from the
    lodgings of Monseigneur de Montmorenci, still tracked by his unknown enemy, and
    thence returned to his own house on horseback attended by several servants. After
    waiting till the night fell, Troilo again left home on horseback preceded by his
    servants with torches. Ambrogio followed at full speed, watched a favorable
    opportunity, and stopped the horse. When I came up with him, I seized the reins with
    my left hand and with my right I set my harquebuss against his side, pushing it with
    such violence that if it had failed to go off it would at any rate have dislodged him
    from his seat. The gun took effect and he fell crying out "Eh! Eh!" In the tumult
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page409" id="page409"></a>{409}</span> which ensued, I
    walked away, and do not know what happened afterwards.' Ambrogio then made his way
    back to his lodgings, recharged his harquebuss, ate some supper and went to bed. He
    told Hieronimo that nothing had occurred that night. Next day he rose as usual, and
    returned to the Court, hoping to hear news of Troilo. In the afternoon, at the
    Italian theatre, he was informed that an Italian had been murdered, at the instance,
    it was thought, of the Grand Duke of Florence. Hieronimo touched his arm, and
    whispered that he must have done the deed; but Ambrogio denied the fact. It seems to
    have been his object to reserve the credit of the murder for himself, and also to
    avoid the possibility of Hieronimo's treachery in case suspicion fell upon him.
    Afterwards he learned that Troilo lay dangerously wounded by a harquebuss. Further
    details made him aware that he was himself suspected of the murder, and that Troilo
    could not recover. He therefore conferred upon the matter with Hieronimo in Notre
    Dame, and both of them resolved to leave Paris secretly. This they did at once,
    relinquishing clothes, arms, and baggage in their lodgings, and reached Italy in
    safety.</p>
    <h4><i>Lodovico dall'Armi</i></h4>
    <p>The relations of trust which <i>bravi</i> occasionally maintained with foreign
    Courts, supply some curious illustrations of their position in Italian society. One
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page410" id="page410"></a>{410}</span> characteristic
    instance may be selected from documents in the Venetian Archives referring to
    Lodovico dall'Armi.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> This man belonged to a noble
    family of Bologna; and there are reasons for supposing that his mother was sister to
    Cardinal Campeggi, famous in the annals of the English Reformation. Outlawed from his
    native city for a homicide, Lodovico adopted the profession of arms and the
    management of secret diplomacy. He first took refuge at the Court of France, where in
    1541 he obtained such credit, especially with the Dauphin, that he was entrusted with
    a mission for raising revolt in Siena against the Spaniards.<a
    name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229"
    class="fnanchor">[229]</a> His transactions in that city with Giulio Salvi, then
    aspiring to its lordship, and in Rome with the French ambassador, led to a conspiracy
    which only awaited the appearance of French troops upon the Tuscan frontier to break
    out into open rebellion. The plot, however, transpired before it had been matured;
    and Lodovico took flight through the Florentine territory. He was arrested at
    Montevarchi and confined in the fortress of Florence, where he made such revelations
    as rendered the extinction of the Sienese revolt an easy matter. After this we do not
    hear of him until he reappears at Venice in the year 1545. He was now accredited to
    the English ambassador with the title of Henry VIII.'s 'Colonel,' and enjoyed the
    consideration accorded to a powerful monarch's privy agent.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page411" id="page411"></a>{411}</span></p>
    <p>His pension amounted to fifty crowns a month, while he kept eight captains at his
    orders, each of whom received half that sum as pay. These subordinates were people of
    some social standing. We find among them a Trissino of Vicenza and a Bonifacio of
    Verona, the one entitled Marquis and the other Count. What the object of Lodovico's
    residence in Italy might be, did not appear. Though he carried letters of
    recommendation from the English Court, he laid no claim to the rank of diplomatic
    envoy. But it was tolerably well known that he employed himself in levying troops.
    Whether these were meant to be used against France or in favor of Savoy, or whether,
    as the Court of Rome suggested, Henry had given orders for the murder of his cousin,
    Cardinal Pole, at Trento, remained an open question. Lodovico might have dwelt in
    peace under the tolerant rule of the Venetians, had he not exposed himself to a
    collision with their police. In the month of August he assaulted the captain of the
    night guard in a street brawl; and it was also proved against him that he had
    despatched two of his men to inflict a wound of infamy upon a gentleman at Treviso.
    These offenses, coinciding with urgent remonstrances from the Papal Curia, gave the
    Venetian Government fair pretext for expelling him from their dominions. A ban was
    therefore published against him and fourteen of his followers. The English ambassador
    declined to interfere in his behalf, and the man left Italy. At the end of<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page412" id="page412"></a>{412}</span> August he appeared at
    Brussels, where he attempted to excuse himself in an interview with the Venetian
    ambassador. Now began a diplomatic correspondence between the English Court and the
    Venetian Council, which clearly demonstrates what kind of importance attached to this
    private agent. The Chancellor Lord Wriothesley, and the Secretary Sir William Paget,
    used considerable urgency to obtain a suspension of the ban against Dall'Armi. After
    four months' negotiation, during which the Papal Court endeavored to neutralize
    Henry's influence, the Doge signed a safe-conduct for five years in favor of the
    bravo. Early in 1546 Lodovico reappeared in Lombardy. At Mantua he delivered a letter
    signed by Henry himself to the Duke Francesco Gonzaga, introducing 'our noble and
    beloved familiar Lodovico Dall'Armi,' and begging the Duke to assist him in such
    matters as he should transact at Mantua in the king's service.<a
    name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230"
    class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Lodovico presented this letter in April; but the Duchess,
    who then acted as regent for her son Francesco, refused to receive him. She alleged
    that the Duke forbade the levying of troops for foreign service, and declined to
    complicate his relations with foreign powers. It seems, from a sufficiently extensive
    correspondence on the affairs of Lodovico, that he was understood by the Italian
    princess to be charged with some special commission for recruiting soldiers against
    the French.</p>
    <p>The peace between England and France, signed <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page413" id="page413"></a>{413}</span> at Guines in June, rendered Lodovico's
    mission nugatory; and the death of Henry VIII. in January 1547 deprived him of his
    only powerful support. Meanwhile he had contrived to incur the serious displeasure of
    the Venetian Republic. In the autumn of 1546 they outlawed one of their own nobles,
    Ser Mafio Bernardo, on the charge of his having revealed state secrets to France.
    About the middle of November, Bernardo, then living in concealment at Ravenna, was
    lured into the pine forest by two men furnished with tokens which secured his
    confidence. He was there murdered, and the assassins turned out to be paid
    instruments of Lodovico. It now came to light that Lodovico and Ser Mafio Bernardo
    had for some time past colluded in political intrigue. If, therefore, the murder had
    a motive, this was found in Lodovico's dread of revelations under the event of Ser
    Mario's capture. Submitted to torture in the prisons of the Ten, Ser Mafio might have
    incriminated his accomplice both with England and Venice. It was obvious why he had
    been murdered by Lodovico's men. Dall'Armi was consequently arrested and confined in
    Venice. After examination, followed by a temporary release, he prudently took flight
    into the Duchy of Milan. Though they held proof of his guilt in the matter of Ser
    Mafio's murder, the Venetians were apparently unwilling to proceed to extremities
    against the King of England's man. Early in February, however, Sir William Paget
    surrendered him in the name of Lord Pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page414"
    id="page414"></a>{414}</span> tector Somerset to the discretion of S. Mark. Furnished
    with this assurance that Dall'Armi had lost the favor of England, the Signory wrote
    to demand his arrest and extradition from the Spanish governor in Milan. He was in
    fact arrested on February 10. The letter announcing his capture describes him as a
    man of remarkably handsome figure, accustomed to wear a crimson velvet cloak and a
    red cap trimmed with gold. It is exactly in this costume that Lodovico has been
    represented by Bonifazio in a picture of the Massacre of the Innocents. The bravo
    there stands with his back partly turned, gazing stolidly upon a complex scene of
    bloodshed. He wears a crimson velvet mantle, scarlet cap and white feather, scarlet
    stockings, crimson velvet shoes, and rose-colored silk underjacket. His person is
    that of a gallant past the age of thirty, high-complexioned, with short brown beard,
    spare whiskers and moustache. He is good to look at, except that the sharp set mouth
    suggests cynical vulgarity and shallow rashness. On being arrested in Milan, Lodovico
    proclaimed himself a privileged person <i>(persona pubblica)</i>, bearing credentials
    from the King of England; and, during the first weeks of his confinement, he wrote to
    the Emperor for help. This was an idle step. Henry's death had left him without
    protectors, and Charles V. felt no hesitation in abandoning his suppliant to the
    Venetians. When the usual formalities regarding extradition had been completed, the
    Milanese Government delivered Lo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page415"
    id="page415"></a>{415}</span> dovico at the end of April into the hands of the Rector
    of Brescia, who forwarded him under a guard of two hundred men to Padua. He was
    hand-cuffed; and special directions were given regarding his safety, it being even
    prescribed that if he refused food it should be thrust down his throat. What passed
    in the prisons of the State, after his arrival at Venice, is not known. But on May
    14, he was beheaded between the columns on the Molo.</p>
    <p>Venice, at this epoch, incurred the reproaches of her neighbors for harboring
    adventurers of Lodovico's stamp. One of the Fregosi of Genoa a certain Valerio, and
    Pietro Strozzi, the notorious French agent, all of whom habitually haunted the
    lagoons, roused sufficient public anxiety to necessitate diplomatic communications
    between Courts, and to disquiet fretful Italian princelings. Banished from their own
    provinces, and plying a petty Condottiere trade, such men, when they came together on
    a neutral ground, engaged in cross-intrigues which made them politically dangerous.
    They served no interest but that of their own egotism, and they were notoriously
    unscrupulous in the means employed to effect immediate objects. At the same time, the
    protection which they claimed from foreign potentates withdrew them from the
    customary justice of the State. Bedmar's conspiracy in 1617-18 revealed to Venice the
    full extent of the peril which this harborage of ruffians involved; for though
    grandees of the distinction of the Duke of Ossuna were involved in it, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page416" id="page416"></a>{416}</span> the main agents, on
    whose ambition and audacity all depended, sprang from those French, English, Spanish,
    and Italian mercenaries, who crowded the low quarters of the city, alert for any
    mischief, and inflamed with the wildest projects of self-aggrandizement by policy and
    bloodshed. Nothing testifies to the social and political decrepitude of Italy in this
    period more plainly than the importance which folk like Lodovico Dall'Armi acquired,
    and the revolutionary force which a man like Jaffier commanded.</p>
    <h4><i>Brigands, Pirates, Plague</i></h4>
    <p>After collecting these stories, which illustrate the manners of the upper classes
    in society and prove their dependence upon henchmen paid to subserve lawless
    passions, it would be interesting to lay bare the life of the common people with
    equal lucidity. This, however, is a more difficult matter. Statistics of dubious
    value can indeed be gathered regarding the desolation of villages by brigands, the
    multitudes destroyed by pestilence and famine, and the inroads of Mediterranean
    pirates. I propose, therefore, to touch lightly upon these points, and especially to
    use our records of plague in different Italian districts as tests for contrasting the
    condition of the people at this epoch with that of the same people in the Middle
    Ages.</p>
    <p>Brigandage, though this was certainly a curse of the first magnitude to Central
    and Southern Italy, cannot be paralleled, either for the miseries <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page417" id="page417"></a>{417}</span> it inflicted, or for
    the ferocity it stimulated, with the municipal warfare of the twelfth, thirteenth and
    fourteenth centuries. In those internecine struggles whole cities disappeared, and
    fertile districts were periodically abandoned to wolves. The bands of an Alfonso
    Piccolomini or a Sciarra Colonna plundered villages, exacted black mail, and held
    prisoners for ransom.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But their barbarities were
    insignificant, when compared with those commonly perpetrated by wandering companies
    of adventure before the days of Alberigo da Barbiano; nor did brigands cost Italy so
    much as the mercenary troops, which, after the Condottiere system had been developed,
    became a permanent drain upon the resources of the country. The raids of Tunisian and
    Algerian Corsairs were more seriously mischievous; since the whole sea-board from
    Nice to Reggio lay open to the ravages of such incarnate fiends as Barbarossa and
    Dragut, while the Adriatic was infested by Uscocchi, and the natives of the Regno not
    unfrequently turned pirates in emulation of their persecutors.<a
    name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232"
    class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>
    <p>Yet even these injuries may be reckoned light, when we consider what Italy had
    suffered between 1494 and 1527 from French, Spanish, German and Swiss troops in
    combat on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page418" id="page418"></a>{418}</span> her
    soil. The pestilences of the Middle Ages notably the Black Death of 1348, of which
    Boccaccio has left an immortal description, exceeded in virulence those which
    depopulated Italian cities during the period of my history. But plagues continued to
    be frequent; and some of these are so memorable that they require to be particularly
    noticed. At Venice in 1575-77, a total of about 50,000 persons perished; and in
    1630-31, 46,490 were carried off within a space of sixteen months in the city, while
    the number of those who died at large in the lagoons amounted to 94,235.<a
    name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233"
    class="fnanchor">[233]</a> On these two occasions the Venetians commemorated their
    deliverance by the erection of the Redentore and S. Maria della Salute, churches
    which now form principal ornaments of the Giudecca and the Grand Canal. Milan was
    devastated at the same periods by plagues, of which we have detailed accounts in the
    dispatches of resident Venetian envoys.<a name="FNanchor_234_234"
    id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The
    mortality in the second of these visitations was terrible. Before September 1629,
    fourteen thousand had succumbed; between May and August 1630, forty-five thousand
    victims had been added to the tale.<a name="FNanchor_235_235"
    id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>
    <p>At Naples in the year 1656, more than fifty thousand perished between May and
    July; the dead were cast naked into the sea, and the Venetian envoy describes the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page419" id="page419"></a>{419}</span> city as <i>'non
    pi&ugrave; citt&agrave; ma spelonca di morti</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_236_236"
    id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> In
    July his diary is suddenly interrupted, whether by departure from the stricken town,
    or more probably by death, we know not. Savoy was scourged by a fearful pestilence in
    the years 1598-1600. Of this plague we possess a frightfully graphic picture in the
    same accurate series of the State documents.<a name="FNanchor_237_237"
    id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
    Simeone Contarini, then resident at Savigliano, relates that more than two-thirds of
    the population in that province had been swept away before the autumn of 1598, and
    that the evil was spreading far and wide through Piedmont. In Alpignano, a village of
    some four hundred inhabitants, only two remained. In Val Moriana, forty thousand
    expired out of a total of seventy thousand. The village of San Giovanni counted but
    twelve survivors from a population of more than four thousand souls. In May 1599, the
    inhabitants of Turin were reduced by flight and death to four thousand; and of these
    there died daily numbers gradually rising through the summer from 50 to 180. The
    streets were encumbered with unburied corpses, the houses infested by robbers and
    marauders. Some incidents reported of this plague are ghastly in their horror. The
    infected were treated with inhuman barbarity, and retorted with savage fury,
    battering their assailants with the pestiferous bodies of unburied victims.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page420" id="page420"></a>{420}</span> To the
    miseries of pestilence and its attendant famine were added lawlessness and license,
    raging fires, and what was worst of all, the dark suspicion that the sickness had
    been introduced by malefactors. This belief appears to have taken hold upon the
    popular mind during the plague of 1598 in Savoy and in Milan.<a
    name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238"
    class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Simeone Contarini reports that two men from Geneva
    confessed to having come with the express purpose of disseminating infection. He also
    gives curious particulars of two who were burned, and four who were quartered at
    Turin in 1600 for this offense.<a name="FNanchor_239_239"
    id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
    'These spirits of hell,' as he calls them, indicated a wood in which they declared
    that they had buried a pestilential liquid intended to be used for smearing houses.
    The wood was searched, and some jars were discovered. A surgeon at the same epoch
    confessed to having meant to spread the plague at Mondovi. Other persons, declaring
    themselves guilty of a similar intention, described a horn filled with poisonous
    stuff collected from the sores of plague-stricken corpses, which they had concealed
    outside the walls of Turin. This too was discovered; and these apparent proofs of
    guilt so infuriated the people that every day some criminals were sacrificed to
    judicial vengeance.</p>
    <p>The name given to the unfortunate creatures <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page421" id="page421"></a>{421}</span> accused of this diabolical conspiracy
    was <i>Untori</i> or the Smearers. The plague of Milan in 1629-30 obtained the name
    of 'La Peste degli Untori' (as that of 1576 had been called 'La Peste di S. Carlo'),
    because of the prominent part played in it by the smearers.<a name="FNanchor_240_240"
    id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> They
    were popularly supposed to go about the city daubing walls, doors, furniture,
    choir-stalls, flowers, and articles of food with plague stuff. They scattered powders
    in the air, or spread them in circles on the pavement. To set a foot upon one of
    these circles involved certain destruction. Hundreds of such <i>untori</i> were
    condemned to the most cruel deaths by justice firmly persuaded of their criminality.
    Exposed to prolonged tortures, the majority confessed palpable absurdities. One woman
    at Milan said she had killed four thousand people. But, says Pier Antonio Marioni,
    the Venetian envoy, although tormented to the utmost, none of them were capable of
    revealing the prime instigators of the plot. So thoroughly convinced was he, together
    with the whole world, of their guilt, that he never paused to reflect upon the
    fallacy contained in this remark. The rack-stretched wretches could not reveal their
    instigators, because there were none; and the acts of which they accused themselves
    were the delirious figments of their own torture-fretted brains. We possess documents
    relating to the trial of the Milanese <i>untori</i>, which make it clear that crimes
    of this sort must have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page422"
    id="page422"></a>{422}</span> been imaginary. As in cases of witchcraft, the first
    accusation was founded upon gossip and delation. The judicial proceedings were ruled
    by prejudice and cruelty. Fear and physical pain extorted confessions and complicated
    accusations of their neighbors from multitudes of innocent people.<a
    name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241"
    class="fnanchor">[241]</a> Indeed the parallel between these unfortunate smearers and
    no less wretched witches is a close one. I am inclined to think that, as some crazy
    women fancied they were witches, so some morbid persons of this period in Italy
    believed in their power of spreading plague, and yielded to the fascination of
    malignity. Whether such moral mad folk really extended the sphere of the pestilence
    to any appreciable extent remains a matter for conjecture; and it is quite certain
    that all but a small percentage of the accused were victims of calumny.</p>
    <p>After taking brigandage, piracy, and pestilence into account, the decline of Italy
    must be attributed to other causes. These I believe to have been the extinction of
    commercial republics, the decay of free commonwealths, iniquitous systems of
    taxation, the insane display of wealth by unproductive princes, and the diversion of
    trade into foreign channels. Florence ceased to be the center of wool manufacture,
    Venice lost her hold upon the traffic between East <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page423" id="page423"></a>{423}</span> and West.<a name="FNanchor_242_242"
    id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
    Stagnation fell like night upon the land, and the population suffered from a general
    atrophy.</p>
    <h4><i>The Proletariate</i></h4>
    <p>In what concerns social morality it would be almost impossible to define the
    position of the proletariate, tillers of the soil, and artisans, at this epoch. These
    classes vary in their goodness and their badness, in their drawbacks and advantages,
    from age to age far less than those who mold the character of marked historical
    periods by culture. They enjoy indeed a greater or a smaller immunity from pressing
    miseries. They are innocent or criminal in different degrees. But the ground-work of
    humanity in them remains comparatively unaltered; and their moral qualities, so far
    as these may be exceptional, reflect the influences of an upper social stratum. It is
    clear from the histories related in this chapter that members of the lowest classes
    were continually mixing with the nobles and the gentry in the wild adventures of that
    troubled century. They, like their betters, were undergoing a tardy <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>{424}</span> metamorphosis from
    mediaeval to modern conditions, retaining vices of ferocity and grossness, virtues of
    loyalty and self-reliance, which belonged to earlier periods. They, too, were now
    infected by the sensuous romance of pietism, the superstitious respect for sacraments
    and ceremonial observances which had been wrought by the Catholic Revival into
    ecstatic frenzy. They shared those correlative yearnings after sacrilegious
    debauchery, felt those allurements of magic arts, indulged that perverted sense of
    personal honor which constituted psychological disease in the century which we are
    studying. It can, moreover, be maintained that Italian society at no epoch has been
    so sharply divided into sections as that of the feudalized races. In this period of
    one hundred years, from 1530 to 1630, when education was a privilege of the few, and
    when Church and princes combined to retard intellectual progress, the distinction
    between noble and plebeian, burgher and plowman, though outwardly defined, was
    spiritually and morally insignificant. As in the Renaissance, so now, vice trickled
    downwards from above, infiltrating the masses of the people with its virus. But now,
    even more decidedly than then, the upper classes displayed obliquities of meanness,
    baseness, intemperance, cowardice, and brutal violence, which are commonly supposed
    to characterize villeins.</p>
    <p>I had thought to throw some light upon the manners of the Italian proletariate by
    exploring the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page425" id="page425"></a>{425}</span>
    archives of trials for witchcraft. But I found that these were less common than in
    Germany, France, Spain, and England at a corresponding period. In Italy witchcraft,
    pure and simple, was confined, for the most part, to mountain regions, the Apennines
    of the Abruzzi, and the Alps of Bergamo and Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_243_243"
    id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> In
    other provinces it was confounded with crimes of poisoning, the procuring of
    abortion, and the fomentation of conspiracies in private families. These facts speak
    much for the superior civilization of the Italian people considered as a whole. We
    discover a common fund of intelligence, vice, superstition, prejudice, enthusiasm,
    craft, devotion, self-assertion, possessed by the race at large. Only in districts
    remote from civil life did witchcraft assume those anti-social and repulsive features
    which are familiar to Northern nations. Elsewhere it penetrated, as a subtle poison,
    through society, lending its supposed assistance to passions already powerful enough
    to work their own accomplishment. It existed, not as an endemic disease, a permanent
    delirium of maddened peasants, but as a weapon in the arsenal of malice on a par with
    poisons and provocatives to lust.</p>
    <p>I might illustrate this position by the relation of a fantastic attempt made
    against the life of Pope Urban VIII.<a name="FNanchor_244_244"
    id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a><span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page426" id="page426"></a>{426}</span></p>
    <p>Giacomo Centini, the nephew of Cardinal d'Ascoli, fostered a fixed idea, the
    motive of his madness being the promotion of his uncle to S. Peter's Chair. In 1633
    he applied to a hermit, who professed profound science in the occult arts and close
    familiarity with demons. The man, in answer to Giacomo's inquiries, said that Urban
    had still many years to live, that the Cardinal d'Ascoli would certainly succeed him,
    and that he held it in his power to shorten the Pope's days. He added that a certain
    Fra Cherubino would be useful, if any matter of grave moment were resolved on; nor
    did he reject the assistance of other discreet persons. Giacomo, on his side,
    produced a Fra Domenico; and the four accomplices set at work to destroy the reigning
    Pope by means of sorcery. They caused a knife to be forged, after the model of the
    Key of Solomon, and had it inscribed with Cabalistic symbols. A clean virgin was
    employed to spin hemp into a thread. Then they resorted to a distant room in
    Giacomo's palace, where a circle was drawn with the mystic thread, a fire was lighted
    in the center, and upon it was placed an image of Pope Urban formed of purest wax.
    The devil was invoked to appear and answer whether Urban had deceased this life after
    the melting of the image. No infernal visitor responded to the call; and the hermit
    accounted for this failure by suggesting that some murder had been committed in the
    palace. As things went at that period, this excuse was by no means feeble, if only
    the audience, bent on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page427"
    id="page427"></a>{427}</span> unholy invocation of the power of evil, would accept it
    as sufficient. Probably more than one murder had taken place there, of which the
    owner was dimly conscious. The psychological curiosity to note is that avowed
    malefactors reckoned purity an essential element in their nefarious practice. They
    tried once more in a vineyard, under the open heavens at night. But no demon issued
    from the darkness, and the hermit laid this second mischance to the score of bad
    weather. Giacomo was incapable of holding his tongue. He talked about his undertaking
    to the neighbors, and promised to make them all Cardinals when he should become the
    Papal nephew. Meanwhile he pressed the hermit forward on the path of folly; and this
    man, driven to his wits' end for a device, said that they must find seven priests
    together, one of whom should be assassinated to enforce the spell. It was natural,
    while the countryside was being raked for seven convenient priests by such a tattler
    as Giacomo, that suspicions should be generated in the people. Information reached
    Rome, in consequence of which the persons implicated in this idiotic plot were
    conveyed thither and given over to the mercies of the Holy Office. The upshot of
    their trial was that Giacomo lost his head, while the hermit and Fra Cherubino were
    burned alive, and Fra Domenico went to the galleys for life. Several other men
    involved in the process received punishments of considerable severity. It must be
    added in conclusion <span class="pagenum"><a name="page428"
    id="page428"></a>{428}</span> that the whole story rests upon the testimony of
    Inquisitorial archives, and that the real method of Giacomo Centini's apparent
    madness yet remains to be investigated. The few facts that we know about him, from
    his behavior on the scaffold and a letter he wrote his wife, prejudice me in his
    favor.</p>
    <p>Enough, and more than enough, perhaps, has been collected in this chapter, to
    throw light upon the manners of Italians during the Counter-Reformation. It would
    have been easy to repeat the story of the Countess of Cellant and her murdered
    lovers, or of the Duchess of Amalfi strangled by her brothers for a marriage below
    her station. The massacres committed by the Raspanti in Ravenna would furnish a whole
    series of illustrative crimes. From the deeds of Alfonso Piccolomini, Sciarra and
    Fabrizio Colonna details sufficient to fill a volume with records of atrocious
    savagery could be drawn. The single episode of Elena Campireali, who plighted her
    troth to a bandit, became Abbess of the Convent at Castro, intrigued with a bishop,
    and killed herself for shame on the return of her first lover, would epitomize in one
    drama all the principal features of this social discord. The dreadful tale of the
    Baron of Montebello might be told again, who assaulted the castle of the Marquis of
    Pratidattolo, and, by the connivance of a sister whom he subsequently married,
    murdered the Marquis with his mother, children, and relatives. The hunted life of
    Alessandro Antelminelli, pursued <span class="pagenum"><a name="page429"
    id="page429"></a>{429}</span> through all the States of Europe by assassins, could be
    used to exemplify the miseries of proscribed exiles. But what is the use of
    multiplying instances, when every pedigree in Litta, every chronicle of the time,
    every history of the most insignificant township, swarms with evidence to the same
    purpose? We need not adopt the opinion that society had greatly altered for the
    worse. We must rather decide that mediaeval ferocity survived throughout the whole of
    that period which witnessed the Catholic Revival, and that the piety which
    distinguished it was not influential in curbing vehement passions.</p>
    <p>The conclusions to be drawn from the facts before us seem to be in general these.
    The link between government and governed in Italy had snapped. The social bond was
    broken, and the constituents that form a nation were pursuing divers aims. On the one
    hand stood Popes and princes, founding their claims to absolute authority upon titles
    that had slight rational or national validity. These potentates were ill-combined
    among themselves, and mutually jealous. On the other side were ranged disruptive
    forces of the most heterogeneous kinds&mdash;remnants from antique party-warfare,
    fragments of obsolete domestic feuds, new strivings after freer life in mentally
    down-trodden populations, blending with crime and misery and want and profligacy to
    compose an opposition which exasperated despotism. These anarchical conditions were
    due in large <span class="pagenum"><a name="page430" id="page430"></a>{430}</span>
    measure to the troubles caused by foreign campaigns of invasion. They were also due
    to the Spanish type of manners imposed upon the ruling classes, which the native
    genius accepted with fraudulent intelligence, and to which it adapted itself by
    artifice. We must further reckon the division between cultured and uncultured people,
    which humanism had effected, and which subsisted after the benefits conferred by
    humanism had been withdrawn from the race. The retirement of the commercial
    aristocracy from trade, and their assumption of princely indolence in this period of
    political stagnation, was another factor of importance. But the truest cause of
    Italian retrogression towards barbarism must finally be discerned in the sharp check
    given to intellectual evolution by the repressive forces of the
    Counter-Reformation.</p>

      was in November 1542, by Cardinals Pole and Morone as Legates. It was adjourned in
      July, 1543, on account of insufficient attendance. When it again opened in 1545,
      Pole reappeared as Legate. With him were associated two future Popes, Giov. Maria
      del Monte (Julius III.), and Marcello Cervini (Marcellus II.) The first session of
      the Council took place in December, 1545, four Cardinals, four Archbishops,
      twenty-one Bishops, and five Generals of Orders attending. Among these were only
      five Spanish and two French prelates; no German, unless we count Cristoforo
      Madrazzo, the Cardinal Bishop of Trent, as one. No Protestants appeared; for Paul
      III. had successfully opposed their ultimatum, which demanded that final appeal on
      all debated points should be made to the sole authority of Holy Scripture.</p>

      class="label">[20]</span></a> Throughout the sessions of the Council, Spanish,
      French, and German representatives, whether fathers or ambassadors, maintained the
      theory of Papal subjection to conciliar authority. The Spanish and French were
      unanimous in zeal for episcopal independence. The French and German were united in
      a wish to favor Protestants by reasonable concessions. Thus the Papal supremacy had
      to face serious antagonism, which it eventually conquered by the numerical
      preponderance of the Italian prelates, by the energy of the Jesuits, by diplomatic
      intrigues, and by manipulation of discords in the opposition. Though the Spanish
      fathers held with the French and German on the points of episcopal independence and
      conciliar authority, they disagreed whenever it became a question of compromise
      with Protestants upon details of dogma or ritual. The Papal Court persuaded the
      Catholic sovereigns of Spain and France, and the Emperor, that episcopal
      independence would be dangerous to their own prerogatives; and at every
      inconvenient turn in affairs, it was made clear that Catholic sovereigns,
      threatened by the Protestant revolution, could not afford to separate their cause
      from that of the Pope.</p>

      through his own inability to dispense with the Pope's co-operation as chief of the
      Catholic Church. So long as he opposed the Reformation, it was impossible for him
      to assume an attitude of violent hostility to Rome.</p>

      Alberi, vol. x. p. 40. The case made out against Morone during the pontificate of
      Paul IV. may be studied in Cant&ugrave;, <i>op. cit.</i> vol. ii. pp. 171-192,
      together with his defence in full. It turned mainly on these
      articles:&mdash;unsound opinions regarding justification by faith, salvation by
      Christ's blood, good works, invocation of saints, reliques; dissemination of the
      famous book on the <i>Benefits of Christ's Death</i>; practice with heretics. He
      was imprisoned in the Castle of S. Angelo from June, 1557 till August, 1559.
      Suspicions no doubt fell on him through his friendship with several of the moderate
      reformers, and from the fact that his diocese of Modena was a nest of liberal
      thinkers&mdash;the Grillenzoni, Castelvetro, Filippo Valentini, Faloppio, Camillo
      Molza, Francesco da Porto, Egidio Foscarari, and others, all of whom are described
      by Cant&ugrave;, <i>op. cit.</i> Disc, xxviii. The charges brought against these
      persons prove at once the mainly speculative and innocuous character of Italian
      heresy, and the implacable enmity which a Pope of Caraffa's stamp exercised against
      the slightest shadow of heterodoxy.</p>

      leadership of their chief Guerrero, for the principle of conciliar independence and

      class="label">[49]</span></a> The vague reference of all decrees passed by the
      Tridentine Council to the Pope for interpretation enabled him and his successors to
      manipulate them as they chose. It therefore happened, as Sarpi says ('Tratt. delle
      Mat. Ben.' <i>Opere</i>, vol. iv. p. 161), that no reform, with regard to the
      tenure of benefices, residence, pluralism, etc., which the Council had decided, was
      adopted without qualifying expedients which neutralized its spirit. If the
      continuance of benefices <i>in commendam</i> ceased, the device of <i>pensions</i>
      upon benefices was substituted; and a thousand pretexts put colossal fortunes
      extracted from Church property, now as before, into the hands of Papal nephews.
      Witness the contrivances whereby Cardinal Scipione Borghese enriched himself in the
      Papacy of Paul V. The Council had decreed the residence of bishops in their sees;
      but it had reserved to the Pope a power of dispensation; so that those whom he
      chose to exile from Rome were bound to reside, and those whom he desired to have
      about him were released from this obligation. On each and all delicate points the
      Papacy was more autocratic after than before the Council. One of Sarpi's letters
      (vol. i. p. 371) to Jacques Leschassier, dated December 22, 1609, should be studied
      by those who wish to penetrate the '<i>reserve ed altre arcane arti</i>,' the
      '<i>renunzie</i>', '<i>pensioni</i>' and '<i>altri stratagemmi</i>,' by means of
      which the Papal Curia, during the half-century after the Tridentine Council,
      managed to evade its decrees, and to get such control over Church property in Italy
      that 'out of 500 benefices not one is conferred legally.' Compare the passage in
      the 'Trattato delle Materie Beneficiarie,' p. 163. There Sarpi says that
      five-sixths of Italian benefices are at the Pope's disposal, and that there is good
      reason to suppose that he will acquire the remaining sixth.</p>

      V.'s nepotism. He describes the pleasure which this Pope took on one day of each
      week in washing his hands in the gold of the Datatario and the Camera (vol. i. p.
      281), and says of him, 'attende solo a far danari' (vol. ii. p. 237). When Paul
      gave his nephew Scipione the Abbey of Vangadizza, with 12,000 ducats a year, Sarpi
      computed that the Cardinal held about 100,000 ducats of ecclesiastical benefices
      (vol. i. p. 219). When the Archbishopric of Bologna, worth over 16,000 ducats a
      year, fell vacant in 1610, Paul gave this to Scipione, who held it a short time
      without residence, and then abandoned it to Alessandro Ludovisi retaining all its
      revenues, with the exception of 2,000 ducats, for himself as a <i>pension</i> (vol.
      ii. pp. 158, 300). In the year 1610 Sarpi notices the purchase of Sulmona and other
      fiefs by Paul for his family, at the expenditure of 160,000 ducats (vol. ii. p.
      70). In another place he speaks of another sum of 100,000 spent upon the same
      object (vol. i. p. 249, note). Well might he exclaim, 'Il pontefice e attesa ad
      arrichir la sua casa' (vol. i. p. 294).</p>

      Netherlands during the reign of Charles V. at 50,000; Grotius at 100,000. In the
      reign of Philip II. perhaps another 25,000 were sacrificed. Motley (<i>Rise of the
      Dutch Republic</i>, vol. ii. p. 155) tells how in February 1568 a sentence of the
      Holy Office, confirmed by royal proclamation, condemned all the inhabitants of the
      Netherlands, some three millions of souls, with a few specially excepted persons,
      to death. It was customary to burn the men and bury the women alive. In considering
      this institution as a whole, we must bear in mind that it was extended to Mexico,
      Lima, Carthagena, the Indies, Sicily, Sardinia, Oran, Malta. Of the working of the
      Holy Office in the Spanish and Portuguese colonies we possess but few authentic
      records. The <i>Histoire des Inquisitions</i> of Joseph Lavall&eacute;e (Paris,
      1809) may, however, be consulted. In vol. ii. pp. 5-9 of this work there is a brief
      account of the Inquisition at Goa written by one Pyrard; and pp. 45-157 extend the
      singularly detailed narrative of a Frenchman, Dellon, imprisoned in its dungeons.
      Some curious circumstances respecting delation, prison life, and <i>autos da
      f&eacute;</i> are here minutely recorded.</p>

      she was exposed to the temptations of a Moorish spy, and convicted mainly on the
      evidence furnished by certain Mussulman habits to which she adhered. Llorente
      reports a similar specimen case, vol. i. p. 442. The culprit was a tinker aged 71,
      accused in 1528 of abstaining from pork and wine, and using certain ablutions. He
      defended himself by pleading that, having been converted at the age of 45, it did
      not suit his taste to eat pork or drink wine, and that his trade obliged him to
      maintain cleanliness by frequent washing. He was finally condemned to carry a
      candle at an <i>auto da f&eacute;</i> in sign of penitence, and to pay four ducats,
      the costs of his trial. His detention lasted from September, 1529, till December

      disputed: as, for instance, in some minor details by Prescott (<i>Ferd. and
      Isab.</i> vol. iii. p. 492). The truth is that no data now exist for forming a
      correct census of the victims of the Spanish Moloch; and Llorente, though he writes
      with the moderation of evident sincerity, and though he had access to the archives
      of the Inquisition, does not profess to do more than give an estimate based upon
      certain fixed data. However, it signifies but little whether we reckon by thousands
      or by fifteen hundreds. That foul monster spawned in the unholy embracements of
      perverted religion with purblind despotism cannot be defended by discounting five
      or even ten per cent. Let its apologists write for every 1000 of Llorente 100, and
      for every 100 of Llorente 10, and our position will remain unaltered. The Jesuit
      historian of Spain, Mariana, records the burning-of 2000 persons in Andalusia alone
      in 1482. Bernaldez mentions 700 burned in the one town of Seville between 1482 and
      1489. An inscription carved above the portals of the Holy Office in Seville stated
      that about 1000 had been burned between 1492 and 1524.</p>

      cit.</i> p. 232-236. The five men were Giulio Gherlandi of Spresian, near Treviso
      (executed in 1562), Antonio Rizzetta of Vicenza (in 1566), Francesco Sega of Rovigo
      (sentenced in 1566), Francesco Spinola of Milan (in 1567), and Fra Baldo Lupatino
      (1556). McCrie bases his report upon the <i>Histoire des Martyrs</i>
      (Gen&egrave;ve, 1597) and De Porta's <i>Historia Reformationis Rhaeticarum
      Ecclesiarum</i>. Thinking these sources somewhat suspicious, I applied to my friend
      Mr. H.F. Brown, whose researches in the Venetian archives are becoming known to
      students of Italian history. He tells me that all the above cases, except that of
      Spinola, exist in the Frari. Lupatino was condemned as a Lutheran; the others as
      Anabaptists. In passing sentence on Lupatino, the Chief Inquisitor remarked that he
      could not condemn him to death by fire in Venice, but must consign him to a watery
      grave. This is characteristic of Venetian state policy. It appears that, of the
      above-named persons, Sega, though sentenced to death by drowning, recanted at the
      last moment, saying, 'Non voglio esser negato, ma voglio redirmi et morir buon
      Christiano.' Mr. Brown adds that there is nothing in the archives to prove that he
      was executed; but there is also nothing to show that his sentence was commuted. Two
      other persons involved in this trial, viz. Nic. Bucello of Padua and Alessio of
      Bellinzona, upon recantation, were subjected to public penances and confessions for
      different terms of years. Sega's fate must, therefore, be considered doubtful;
      since the fact that no commutation of sentence is on record lends some weight to
      the hypothesis that he withdrew his recantation, and submitted to martyrdom. I will
      close this note by expressing my hope that Mr. Brown, who is already engaged upon
      the papers of the Venetian Holy Office, will make them shortly the subject of a
      special publication. Considering how rare are the full and authentic records of any
      Inquisition, this would be of incalculable value for students of history. The
      series of trials in the Frari extends from 1541 to 1794, embracing 1562
      <i>processi</i> for the sixteenth century, 1469 for the seventeenth, 541 for the
      eighteenth, and 25 of no date. Nearly all the towns and districts of the Venetian
      State are involved.</p>

      abound in useful information on this topic. Writing to French correspondents, he
      complains weekly of the impossibility even in Venice of obtaining books. See, for
      instance, <i>Lettere</i>, vol. i. pp. 286, 287, 360, vol. ii. p. 13. In one passage
      he says that the importation of books into Italy is impeded at Innsbruck, Trento,
      and throughout the Tyrolese frontiers (vol. i. p. 74). In another he warns his
      friends not to send them concealed in merchandise, since they will fall under so
      many eyes in the custom-houses and lazzaretti (vol. i. p. 303).</p>

      printed by Dejob, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 491, is signed by Giustiniano Finetti, who
      seems to have been a professor of medicine in the Roman University. His son, a
      youth of sixteen, complained that the students had demanded and obtained leave to
      recite a certain 'lettione che era carnavalesca d'ano et de priapo,' adding that
      they were in the habit of holding debates upon the thesis that (LATIN: 'res sodcae
      erant praeferendae veneri naturali, et reprobabant rem veneream cum feminis ac
      audabant masturbationem.') The dialogue which the students obtained leave publicly
      to recite was probably similar to one that might still be heard some years ago in
      spring upon the quays of Naples, and which appeared to have descended from
      immemorial antiquity.</p>

      books against the writings of Baronius, who was treated as a saint, vol. i. pp. 3,
      147, ii. p. 35. He relates how the Jesuits had procured the destruction of a book
      written to uphold aristocracy in states, without touching upon ecclesiastical
      questions, as being unfavorable to their theories of absolutism (vol. i. p. 122).
      He tells the story of a confessor who refused the sacraments to a nobleman, because
      he owned a treatise written by Quirino in defense of the Venetian prerogatives
      (vol. i. p. 113). He refers to the suppression of James I.'s <i>Apologia</i> and De
      Thou's <i>Histories</i> (vol. i. pp. 286, 287, 383).</p>

      with heretics was accounted sufficient to implicate an Italian in the charge of
      heresy. Sarpi's Letters are full of matter on this point. He always used Cipher,
      which he frequently changed, addressed his letters under feigned names, and finally
      resolved on writing in his own hand to no heretic. See <i>Lettere</i>, vol. ii. pp.
      2, 151, 242, 248, 437. See also what Dejob relates about the timidity of Muretus,

      this phrase see his <i>Lettere</i>, vol. ii. pp. 72, 80, 92. He clearly recognized
      the solidarity between the Jesuits and Spain. 'The Jesuit is no more separable from
      the Spaniard than the accident from the substance.' 'The Spaniard without the
      Jesuit is not worth more than lettuce without oil.' 'For the Jesuits to deceive
      Spain, would be tantamount to deceiving themselves.' <i>Ibid.</i> vol. i. pp. 203,
      384, vol. ii. p. 48. Compare passages in vol. i. pp. 184, 189. He only perceived a
      difference in the degrees of their noxiousness to Europe. Thus, 'the worst Spaniard
      is better than the least bad of the Jesuits' (vol. i. p. 212).</p>

      names of these illustrious Frenchmen, I feel bound to point out how accurately
      their criticism of the Jesuits was anticipated by Paolo Sarpi. His correspondence
      between the years 1608 and 1622 demonstrates that this body of social corrupters
      had been early recognized by him in their true light. Sarpi calls them
      'sottilissimi maestri in mal fare,' 'donde esce ogni falsit&agrave; et bestemmia,'
      'il vero morbo Gallico,' 'peste pubblica,' 'peste del mondo' (<i>Letters</i>, vol.
      i. pp. 142, 183, 245, ii. 82, 109). He says that they 'hanno messo l'ultima mano a
      stabilire una corruzione universale' (<i>ib.</i> vol. i. p. 304). By their
      equivocations and mental reservations 'fanno essi prova di gabbare Iddio'
      (<i>ib.</i> vol. ii. p. 82). 'La menzogna non iscusano soltanto ma lodano'
      (<i>ib.</i> vol. ii. p. 106). So far, the utterances which I have quoted might pass
      for the rhetoric of mere spite. But the portrait gradually becomes more definite in
      details limned from life. 'The Jesuits have so many loopholes for escape, pretexts,
      colors of insinuation, that they are more changeful than the Sophist of Plato; and
      when one thinks to have caught them between thumb and finger, they wriggle out and
      vanish' (<i>ib.</i> vol. i. p. 230). 'The Jesuit fathers have methods of acquiring
      in this world, and making their neophytes acquire, heaven without diminution, or
      rather with augmentation, of this life's indulgences' (<i>ib.</i> vol. i. p. 313).
      'The Jesuit fathers used to confer Paradise; they now have become dispensers of
      fame in this world' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 363). 'When they seek entrance into any place,
      they do not hesitate to make what promises may be demanded of them, possessing as
      they do the art of escape by lying with equivocations and mental reservations'
      (<i>ib.</i> vol. ii. p. 147). 'The Jesuit is a man of every color; he repeats the
      marvel of the chameleon' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 105). 'When they play a losing game, they
      yet rise winners from the table. For it is their habit to insinuate themselves upon
      any condition demanded, having arts enough whereby to make themselves masters of
      those who bind them by prescribed rules. They are glad to enter in the guise of
      galley-slaves with irons on their ankles; since, when they have got in, they will
      find no difficulty in loosing their own bonds and binding others' (<i>ibid.</i> p.
      134). 'They command two arts: the one of escaping from the bonds and obligations of
      any vow or promise they shall have made, by means of equivocation, tacit
      reservation, and mental restriction; the other of insinuating, like the hedgehog,
      into the narrowest recesses, being well aware that when they unfold their piercing
      bristles, they will obtain the full possession of the dwelling and exclude its
      master' <i>(ibid</i>. p. 144). 'Everybody in Italy is well aware how they have
      wrought confession into an art. They never receive confidences under that seal
      without disclosing all particulars in the conferences of their Society; and that
      with the view of using confession to the advantage of their order and the Church.
      At the same time they preach the doctrine that the seal of the confessional
      precludes a penitent from disclosing what the confessor may have said to him,
      albeit his utterances have had no reference to sins or to the safety of the soul'
      (<i>ib.</i> vol. ii. p. 108). 'Should the Jesuits in France get hold of education,
      they will dominate the university, and eradicate sound letters. Yet why do I speak
      of healthy literature? I ought to have said good and wholesome doctrine, the which
      is verily mortal to that Company' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 162). 'Every species of vice
      finds its patronage in them. The avaricious trust their maxims, for trafficking in
      spiritual commodities; the superstitious, for substituting kisses upon images for
      the exercise of Christian virtues; the base fry of ambitious upstarts, for cloaking
      every act of scoundreldom with a veil of holiness. The indifferent find in them a
      palliative for their spiritual deadness; and whoso fears no God, has a visible God
      ready made for him, whom he may worship with merit to his soul. In fine, there is
      nor perjury, nor sacrilege, nor parricide, nor incest, nor rapine, nor fraud, nor
      treason, which cannot be masked as meritorious beneath the mantle of their
      dispensation' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 330). 'I apprehend the difficulty of attacking their
      teachings; seeing that they merge their own interests with those of the Papacy; and
      that not only in the article of Pontifical authority, but in all points. At present
      they stand for themselves upon the ground of equivocations. But believe me, they
      will adjust this also, and that speedily; forasmuch as they are omnipotent in the
      Roman Court, and the Pope himself fears them' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 333). 'Had S. Peter
      known the creed of the Jesuits, he could have found a way to deny our Lord without
      sinning' (<i>ibid.</i> p. 353). 'The Roman Court will never condemn Jesuit
      doctrine; for this is the secret of its empire&mdash;a secret of the highest and
      most capital importance, whereby those who openly refuse to worship it are
      excommunicated, and those who would do so if they dared, are held in check'
      (<i>ibid.</i> p. 105). The object of this lengthy note is to vindicate for Sarpi a
      prominent and early place among those candid analysts of Jesuitry who now are lost
      in the great light of Pascal's genius. Sarpi's <i>Familiar Letters</i> have for my
      mind even more weight than the famous <i>Lettres Provinciales</i> of Pascal. They
      were written with no polemical or literary bias, at a period when Jesuitry was in
      its prime; and their force as evidence is strengthened by their obvious
      spontaneity. A book of some utility was published in 1703 at Salzburg (?), under
      the title of <i>Artes Jesuiticae</i> Christianus Aletophilus. This contains a
      compendium of those passages in casuistical writings on which Pascal based his
      brilliant satires. Paul Bert's modern work, <i>La Morale des J&eacute;suites</i>
      (Paris: Charpentier, 1881), is intended to prove that recent casuistical treatises
      of the school repeat those ancient perversions of sound morals.</p>

      (Dandolo, <i>Signora di Monza</i>, p. 132). 'Experience of similar cases has shown
      how dangerous to your holy state is the vicinity of soldiers, owing to the
      correspondence which young and idle soldiers continually try to entertain with
      monasteries, sometimes even under fair and honorable pretexts.... Wherefore we have
      heard with much displeasure that in those places of our diocese where there are
      convents of nuns and congregations of virgins, ordinary lodgings for the soldiery
      have been established, called lonely houses (<i>case erme</i>), where they are
      suffered or obliged to dwell through long periods.' The Bishop commands the
      Prioress to admit no soldier, on any plea of piety, devotion or family
      relationship, into her convent; to receive no servant or emissary of a soldier; to
      forbid special services being performed in the chapel at the instance of a soldier;
      and, finally, to institute a more rigorous system of watch and ward than had been

      aroused the anger of Paul IV. De Stendhal's MS. shifts the chief blame on to the

      stories in this chapter as dryly as I could. Yet it would be interesting to analyze
      the fascination they exercised over our Elizabethan playwrights, some of whose
      Italian tragedies handle the material with penetrative imagination. For the English
      mode of interpreting southern passions see my <i>Italian Byways</i>, pp. 142 <i>et

      discover, the only church of San Spirito in Venice was a building on the island of
      San Spirito, erected by Sansavino, which belonged to the Sestiere di S. Croce, and
      which was suppressed in 1656. Its plate and the fine pictures which Titian painted
      there were transferred at that date to S. M. della Salute. I cannot help inferring
      that either Bibboni's memory failed him, or that his words were wrongly understood
      by printer or amanuensis. If for S. Spirito, we substitute S. Stefano, the account
      would be intelligible.</p>

      covered with its sculpture. The public prostitutes were reckoned then at 11,654.
      Adulteries, rapes, infanticides were matters of daily occurrence. Yet the
      Renaissance had not begun, and the expansion of Venice, which roused the envious
      hostility of Europe, had yet to happen.</p>
