    </div>
    <p>It was under the conditions which have been set forth in the foregoing chapters
    that the greatest literary genius of his years in Europe, the poet who ranks among
    the four first of Italy, was educated, rose to eminence, and suffered. The
    political<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>{2}</span> changes
    introduced in 1530, the tendencies of the Catholic Revival, the terrorism of the
    Inquisition, and the educational energy of the Jesuits had, each and all, their
    manifest effect in molding Tasso's character. He represents that period when the
    culture of the Renaissance was being superseded, when the caries of court-service was
    eating into the bone and marrow of Italian life, when earlier forms of art were
    tending to decay, or were passing into the new form of music. Tasso was at once the
    representative poet of his age and the representative martyr of his age. He was the
    latter, though this may seem paradoxical, in even a stricter sense than Bruno. Bruno,
    coming into violent collision with the prejudices of the century, expiated his
    antagonism by a cruel death. Tasso, yielding to those influences, lingered out a life
    of irresolute misery. His nature was such, that the very conditions which shaped it
    sufficed to enfeeble, envenom, and finally reduce it to a pitiable ruin.</p>
    <p>Some memorable words of Cesare Balbi may serve as introduction to a sketch of
    Tasso's life. 'If that can be called felicity which gives to the people peace without
    activity; to nobles rank without power; to princes undisturbed authority within their
    States without true independence or full sovereignty; to literary men and artists
    numerous occasions for writing, painting, making statues, and erecting edifices with
    the applause of contemporaries but the ridicule of posterity; to the whole nation
    ease <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>{3}</span>without dignity
    and facilities for sinking tranquilly into corruption; then no period of her history
    was so felicitous for Italy as the 140 years which followed the peace of
    Cateau-Cambr&egrave;sis. Invasions ceased: her foreign lord saved Italy from
    intermeddling rivals. Internal struggles ceased: her foreign lord removed their
    causes and curbed national ambitions. Popular revolutions ceased: her foreign lord
    bitted and bridled the population of her provinces. Of bravi, highwaymen, vulgar acts
    of vengeance, tragedies among nobles and princes, we find indeed abundance; but these
    affected the mass of the people to no serious extent. The Italians enjoyed life,
    indulged in the sweets of leisure, the sweets of vice, the sweets of making love and
    dangling after women. From the camp and the council-chamber, where they had formerly
    been bred, the nobles passed into petty courts and moldered in a multitude of little
    capitals. Men bearing historic names, insensible of their own degradation, bowed the
    neck gladly, groveled in beatitude. Deprived of power, they consoled themselves with
    privileges, patented favors, impertinences vented on the common people. The princes
    amused themselves by debasing the old aristocracy to the mire, depreciating their
    honors by the creations of new titles, multiplying frivolous concessions, adding
    class to class of idle and servile dependents on their personal bounty. In one word,
    the paradise of mediocrities came into being.'</p>
    <p>Tasso was born before the beginning of this <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
    id="page4"></a>{4}</span> epoch. But he lived into the last decade of the sixteenth
    century. In every fiber of his character he felt the influences of Italian decadence,
    even while he reacted against them. His misfortunes resulted in great measure from
    his not having wholly discarded the traditions of the Renaissance, though his
    temperament and acquired habits made him in many points sympathetic to the
    Counter-Reformation. At the same time, he was not a mediocrity, but the last of an
    illustrious race of nobly gifted men of genius. Therefore he never patiently
    submitted to the humiliating conditions which his own conception of the Court, the
    Prince, the Church, and the Italian gentleman logically involved at that period. He
    could not be contented with the paradise of mediocrities described by Balbi. Yet he
    had not strength to live outside its pale. It was the pathos of his situation that he
    persisted in idealizing this paradise, and expected to find in it a paradise of
    exceptional natures. This it could not be. No one turns Circe's pigsty into a
    Parnassus. If Tasso had possessed force of character enough to rend the trammels of
    convention and to live his own life in a self-constructed sphere, he might still have
    been unfortunate. Nature condemned him to suffering. But from the study of his
    history we then had risen invigorated by the contemplation of heroism, instead of
    quitting it, as now we do, with pity, but with pity tempered by a slight
    contempt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span></p>
    <p>Bernardo, the father of Torquato Tasso, drew noble blood from both his parents.
    The Tassi claimed to be a branch of that ancient Guelf house of Delia Torre, lords of
    Milan, who were all but extirpated by the Visconti in the fourteenth century. A
    remnant established themselves in mountain strongholds between Bergamo and Como, and
    afterwards took rank among the more distinguished families of the former city. Manso
    affirms that Bernardo's mother was a daughter of those Venetian Cornari who gave a
    queen to Cyprus.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
    class="fnanchor">[1]</a> He was born at Venice in the year 1493; and, since he died
    in 1568, his life covered the whole period of national glory, humiliation, and
    attempted reconstruction which began with the invasion of Charles VIII. and ended
    with the closing of the Council of Trent. Born in the pontificate of Alexander VI.,
    he witnessed the reigns of Julius II., Leo X., Clement VII., Paul IV., Pius IV., and
    died in that of Pius V.</p>
    <p>All the illustrious works of Italian art and letters were produced while he was
    moving in the society of princes and scholars. He saw the Renaissance in its splendor
    and decline. He watched the growth, progress, and final triumph of the Catholic
    Revival. Having stated that the curve of his existence led upward from a Borgia and
    down to a Ghislieri Vicar of Christ, the merest tyro in Italian history knows what
    vicissitudes it spanned.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>{6}</span> Though the Tassi
    were so noble, Bernardo owned no wealth. He was left an orphan at an early age under
    the care of his uncle, Bishop of Recanati. But in 1520 the poignard of an assassin
    cut short this guardian's life; and, at the age of seventeen, he was thrown upon the
    world. After studying at Padua, where he enjoyed the patronage of Bembo, and laid
    foundations for his future fame as poet, Bernardo entered the service of the Modenese
    Rangoni in the capacity of secretary. Thus began the long career of servitude to
    princes, of which he frequently complained, but which only ended with his death.<a
    name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
    class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The affairs of his first patrons took him to Paris at the
    time when a marriage was arranged between Ren&eacute;e of France and Ercole d'Este.
    He obtained the post of secretary to this princess, and having taken leave of the
    Rangoni, he next established himself at Ferrara. Only for three years, however; for
    in 1532 reasons of which we are ignorant, but which may have been connected with the
    heretical sympathies of Ren&eacute;e, induced him to resign his post. Shortly after
    this date, we find him attached to the person of Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of
    Salerno, one of the chief feudatories and quasi-independent vassals of the Crown of
    Naples. In the quality of secretary he attended this patron through the campaign of
    Tunis in 1535, and accompanied him on all his diplomatic expeditions.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>{7}</span> The Prince of
    Salerno treated him more as an honored friend and confidential adviser than as a paid
    official. His income was good, and leisure was allowed him for the prosecution of his
    literary studies. In this flourishing state of his affairs, Bernardo contracted an
    alliance with Porzia de'Rossi, a lady of a noble house, which came originally from
    Pistoja, but had been established for some generations in Naples. She was connected
    by descent or marriage with the houses of Gambacorti, Caracciolo, and Caraffa. Their
    first child, Cornelia, was born about the year 1537. Their second, Torquato, saw the
    light in March 1544 at Sorrento, where his father had been living some months
    previously and working at his poem, the <i>Amadigi</i>.</p>
    <p>At the time of Torquato's birth Bernardo was away from home, in Lombardy, France,
    and Flanders, traveling on missions from his Prince. However, he returned to Sorrento
    for a short while in 1545, and then again was forced to leave his family. Married at
    the mature age of forty-three, Bernardo was affectionately attached to his young
    wife, and proud of his children. But the exigencies of a courtier's life debarred him
    from enjoying the domestic happiness for which his sober and gentle nature would have
    fitted him. In 1547 the events happened which ruined him for life, separated him for
    ever from Porzia, drove him into indigent exile, and marred the prospects of his
    children. In that year, the Spanish Viceroy, Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
    id="page8"></a>{8}</span> Pietro Toledo, attempted to introduce the Inquisition, on
    its Spanish basis, into Naples. The population resented this exercise of authority
    with the fury of despair, rightly judging that the last remnants of their liberty
    would be devoured by the foul monster of the Holy Office. They besought the Prince of
    Salerno to intercede for them with his master, Charles V., whom he had served loyally
    up to this time, and who might therefore be inclined to yield to his expostulations.
    The Prince doubted much whether it would be prudent to accept the mission of
    intercessor. He had two counsellors, Bernardo Tasso and Vincenzo Martelli. The
    latter, who was an astute Florentine, advised him to undertake nothing so perilous as
    interposition between the Viceroy and the people. Tasso, on the contrary, exhorted
    him to sacrifice personal interest, honors, and glory, for the duty which he owed his
    country. The Prince chose the course which Tasso recommended. Charles V. disgraced
    him, and he fled from Naples to France, adopting openly the cause of his imperial
    sovereign's enemies. He was immediately declared a rebel, with confiscation of his
    fiefs and property. Bernardo and his infant son were included in the sentence. After
    twenty-two years of service, Bernardo now found himself obliged to choose between
    disloyalty to his Prince or a disastrous exile. He took the latter course, and
    followed Ferrante Sanseverino to Paris. But Bernardo Tasso, though proving himself a
    man of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>{9}</span> honor in this
    severe trial, was not of the stuff of Shakespeare's Kent; and when the Prince of
    Salerno suspended payment of his salary he took leave of that master. Some
    differences arising from the discomforts and irritations of both exiles had early
    intervened between them. Tasso was miserably poor. 'I have to stay in bed,' he
    writes, 'to mend my hose; and if it were not for the old arras I brought with me from
    home, I should not know how to cover my nakedness.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3"
    id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Besides this
    he suffered grievously in the separation from his wife, who was detained at Naples by
    her relatives&mdash;'brothers who, instead of being brothers, are deadly foes, cruel
    wild beasts rather than men; a mother who is no mother but a fell enemy, a fury from
    hell rather than a woman.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His wretchedness attained its climax
    when Porzia died suddenly on February 3, 1556. Bernardo suspected that her family had
    poisoned her; and this may well have been. His son Torquato, meanwhile had joined him
    in Rome; but Porzia's brothers refused to surrender his daughter Cornelia, whom they
    married to a Sorrentine gentleman, Marzio Sersale, much to Bernardo's disgust, for
    Sersale was apparently of inferior blood. They also withheld Porzia's dowry and the
    jointure settled on her by Bernardo&mdash;property of considerable value which
    neither he nor Torquato were subsequently able to recover.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>{10}</span> In this
    desperate condition of affairs, without friends or credit, but conscious of his noble
    birth and true to honor, the unhappy poet bethought him of the Church. If he could
    obtain a benefice, he would take orders. But the King of France and Margaret of
    Valois, on whose patronage he relied, turned him a deaf ear; and when war broke out
    between Paul IV. and Spain, he felt it prudent to leave Rome. It was at this epoch
    that Bernardo entered the service of Guidubaldo della Rovere, Duke of Urbino, with
    whom he remained until 1563, when he accepted the post of secretary from Guglielmo,
    Duke of Mantua. He died in 1569 at Ostiglia, so poor that his son could scarcely
    collect money enough to bury him after selling his effects. Manso says that a couple
    of door-curtains, embroidered with the arms of Tasso and De'Rossi, passed on this
    occasion into the wardrobe of the Gonzaghi. Thus it seems that the needy nobleman had
    preserved a scrap of his heraldic trophies till the last, although he had to patch
    his one pain of breeches in bed at Rome. It may be added, as characteristic of
    Bernardo's misfortunes, that even the plain marble sarcophagus, inscribed with the
    words <i>Ossa Bernardi Tassi</i> which Duke Guglielmo erected to his memory in S.
    Egidio at Mantua, was removed in compliance with a papal edict ordering that
    monuments at a certain height above the ground should be destroyed to save the
    dignity of neighboring altars!</p>
    <p>Such were the events of Bernardo Tasso's life.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page11" id="page11"></a>{11}</span> I have dwelt upon them in detail, since
    they foreshadow and illustrate the miseries of his more famous son. In character and
    physical qualities Torquato inherited no little from his father. Bernardo was
    handsome, well-grown, conscious of his double dignity as a nobleman and poet. From
    the rules of honor, as he understood them, he deviated in no important point of
    conduct. Yet the life of courts made him an incorrigible dangler after princely
    favors. The <i>Amadigi</i>, upon which he set such store, was first planned and
    dedicated to Charles V., then altered to suit Henri II. of France, and finally
    adapted to the flattery of Philip II., according as its author's interests with the
    Prince of Salerno and the Duke of Urbino varied. No substantial reward accrued to
    him, however, from its publication. His compliments wasted their sweetness on the
    dull ears of the despot of Madrid. In misfortune Bernardo sank to neither crime nor
    baseness, even when he had no clothes to put upon his back. Yet he took the world to
    witness of his woes, as though his person ought to have been sacred from calamities
    of common manhood. A similar dependent spirit was manifested in his action as a man
    of letters. Before publishing the <i>Amadigi</i> he submitted it to private
    criticism, with the inevitable result of obtaining feigned praises and malevolent
    strictures. Irresolution lay at the root of his treatment of Torquato. While groaning
    under the collar of courtly servitude, he determined <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span> that the youth should study law. While
    reckoning how little his own literary fame had helped him, he resolved that his son
    should adopt a lucrative profession. Yet no sooner had Torquato composed his
    <i>Rinaldo</i>, than the fond parent had it printed, and immediately procured a place
    for him in the train of the Cardinal Luigi d'Este. It is singular that the young man,
    witnessing the wretchedness of his father's life, should not have shunned a like
    career of gilded misery and famous indigence. But Torquato was born to reproduce
    Bernardo's qualities in their feebleness and respectability, to outshine him in
    genius, and to outstrip him in the celebrity of his misfortunes.</p>
    <p>In the absence of his father little Torquato grew up with his mother and sister at
    Sorrento under the care of a good man, Giovanni Angeluzzo who gave him the first
    rudiments of education. He was a precocious infant, grave in manners, quick at
    learning, free from the ordinary naughtinesses of childhood. Manso reports that he
    began to speak at six months, and that from the first he formed syllables with
    precision. His mother Porzia appears to have been a woman of much grace and
    sweetness, but timid and incapable of fighting the hard battle of the world. A
    certain shade of melancholy fell across the boy's path even in these earliest years,
    for Porzia, as we have seen, met with cruel treatment from her relatives, and her
    only support, Bernardo, was far away in exile. In<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span> 1552 she removed with her children to
    Naples, where Torquato was sent at once to the school which the Jesuits had opened
    there in the preceding year. These astute instructors soon perceived that they had no
    ordinary boy to deal with. They did their best to stimulate his mental faculties and
    to exalt his religious sentiments; so that he learned Greek and Latin before the age
    of ten, and was in the habit of communicating at the altar with transports of pious
    ecstasy in his ninth year.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The child recited speeches and poems in
    public, and received an elementary training in the arts of composition. He was in
    fact the infant prodigy of those plausible Fathers, the prize specimen of their
    educational method. As might have been expected, this forcing system overtaxed his
    nerves. He rose daily before daybreak to attack his books, and when the nights were
    long he went to morning school attended by a servant carrying torches.</p>
    <p>Without seeking to press unduly on these circumstances, we may fairly assume that
    Torquato's character received a permanent impression from the fever of study and the
    premature pietism excited in him by the Jesuits in Naples. His servile attitude
    toward speculative thought, that anxious dependence upon ecclesiastical authority,
    that scrupulous mistrust of his own mental faculties, that pretense of solving
    problems by accumulated citations instead of going to the root of the matter, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span> whereby his
    philosophical writings are rendered nugatory, may with probability be traced to the
    mechanical and interested system of the Jesuits. He was their pupil for three years,
    after which he joined his father in Rome. There he seems to have passed at once into
    a healthier atmosphere. Bernardo, though a sound Catholic, was no bigot; and he had
    the good sense to choose an able master for his son&mdash;'a man of profound
    learning, possessed of both the ancient languages, whose method of teaching is the
    finest and most time-saving that has yet been tried; a gentleman withal, with nothing
    of the pedant in him.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The boy was lucky also in the companion
    of his studies, a cousin, Cristoforo Tasso, who had come from Bergamo to profit by
    the tutor's care.</p>
    <p>The young Tasso's home cannot, however, have been a cheerful one. The elderly
    hidalgo sitting up in bed to darn a single pair of hose, the absent mother pining for
    her husband and tormented by her savage brother's avarice, environed the precocious
    child of ten with sad presentiments. That melancholy temperament which he inherited
    from Bernardo was nourished by the half-concealed mysteriously-haunting troubles of
    his parents. And when Porzia died suddenly, in 1556, we can hardly doubt that the
    father broke out before his son into some such expressions of ungovernable grief as
    he openly expressed in the letter to Amerigo Sanse<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page15" id="page15"></a>{15}</span> verino.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
    id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Is it
    possible, then, thought Torquato, that the mother from whose tender kisses and
    streaming tears I was severed but one year ago,<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
    id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> has died of
    poison&mdash;poisoned by my uncles? Sinking into the consciousness of a child so
    sensitive by nature and so early toned to sadness, this terrible suspicion of a
    secret death by poison incorporated itself with the very essence of his melancholy
    humor, and lurked within him to flash forth in madness at a future period of life.
    That he was well acquainted with the doleful situation of his family is proved by his
    first extant letter. Addressed to the noble lady Vittoria Colonna on behalf of
    Bernardo and his sister, this is a remarkable composition for a boy of twelve.<a
    name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
    class="fnanchor">[9]</a> His poor father, he says, is on the point of dying of
    despair, oppressed by the malignity of fortune and the rapacity of impious men. His
    uncle is bent on marrying Cornelia to some needy gentleman, in order to secure her
    mother's estate for himself. 'The grief, illustrious lady, of the loss of property is
    great, but that of blood is crushing. This poor old man has naught but my sister and
    myself; and now that fortune has deprived him of wealth and of the wife he loved like
    his own soul, he cannot bear that that man's avarice should rob him of his beloved
    daughter, with whom he hoped to end in rest these last years of his failing age.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span> In Naples we have
    no friends; for my father's disaster makes every one shy of us: our relatives are our
    enemies. Cornelia is kept in the house of my uncle's kinsman Giangiacopo Coscia,
    where no one is allowed to speak to her or give her letters.'</p>
    <p>In the midst of these afflictions, which already tuned the future poet's utterance
    to a note of plaintive pathos and ingenuous appeal for aid, Torquato's studies were
    continued on a sounder plan and in a healthier spirit than at Naples. The perennial
    consolation of his troubled life, that delight in literature which made him able to
    anticipate the lines of Goethe&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>That naught belongs to me I know,<br />

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>now became the source of an inner brightness which not even the 'malignity of
    fortune,' the 'impiety of men,' the tragedy of his mother's death, the imprisonment
    of his sister, and the ever-present sorrow of his father, 'the poor gentleman fallen
    into misery and misfortune through no fault of his own,' could wholly overcloud. The
    boy had been accustomed in Naples to the applause of his teachers and friends. In
    Rome he began to cherish a presentiment of his own genius. A 'vision splendid' dawned
    upon his mind; and every step he made in knowledge and in mastery of language
    enforced the delightful con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
    id="page17"></a>{17}</span> viction that 'I too am a poet.' Nothing in Tasso's
    character was more tenacious than the consciousness of his vocation and the kind of
    self-support he gained from it. Like the melancholy humor which degenerated into
    madness, this sense of his own intellectual dignity assumed extravagant proportions,
    passed over into vanity, and encouraged him to indulge fantastic dreams of greatness.
    Yet it must be reckoned as a mitigation of his suffering; and what was solid in it at
    the period of which I now am writing, was the certainty of his rare gifts for
    art.</p>
    <p>The Roman residence was broken by Bernardo's journey to Urbino in quest of the
    appointment he expected from Duke Guidubaldo. He sent Torquato with his cousin
    Cristoforo meanwhile to Bergamo, where the boy enjoyed a few months of sympathy and
    freedom. This appears to have been the only period of his life in which Tasso
    experienced the wholesome influences of domesticity. In 1557 his father sent for him
    to Pesaro, and Tasso made his first entrance into a Court at the age of thirteen.
    This event decided the future of his existence. Urbino was not what it had been in
    the time of Duke Federigo, or when Castiglione composed his Mirror of the Courtier on
    its model. Yet it retained the old traditions of gentle living, splendor tempered by
    polite culture, aristocratic urbanity refined by arts and letters. The evil days of
    Spanish manners and Spanish bigotry, of exhausted revenues and insane <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>{18}</span> taxation, were but
    dawning; and the young prince, Francesco Maria, who was destined to survive his heir
    and transfer a ruined duchy to the mortmain of the Church, was now a boy of eight
    years old. In fact, though the Court of Urbino labored already under that manifold
    disease of waste which drained the marrow of Italian principalities, its atrophy was
    not apparent to the eye. It could still boast of magnificent pageants, trains of
    noble youths and ladies moving through its stately palaces and shady villa-gardens,
    academies of learned men discussing the merits of Homer and Ariosto and discoursing
    on the principles of poetry and drama. Bernardo Tasso read his <i>Amadigi</i> in the
    evenings to the Duchess. The days were spent in hunting and athletic exercises; the
    nights in masquerades or dances. Love and ambition wore an external garb of
    ceremonious beauty; the former draped itself in sonnets, the latter in rhetorical
    orations. Torquato, who was assigned as the companion in sport and study to the
    heir-apparent, shared in all these pleasures of the Court. After the melancholy of
    Rome, his visionary nature expanded under influences which he idealized with fatal
    facility. Too young to penetrate below that glittering surface, flattered by the
    attention paid to his personal charm or premature genius, stimulated by the
    conversation of politely educated pedants, encouraged in studies for which he felt a
    natural aptitude, gratified by the comradeship of the young prince whose temperament
    corresponded to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span>
    his own in gravity, he conceived that radiant and romantic conception of Courts, as
    the only fit places of abode for men of noble birth and eminent abilities, which no
    disillusionment in after life was able to obscure. We cannot blame him for this
    error, though error it indubitably was. It was one which he shared with all men of
    his station at that period, which the poverty of his estate, the habits of his
    father, and his own ignorance of home-life almost forced upon his poet's
    temperament.</p>
    <p>At Urbino Tasso read mathematics under a real master, Federigo Comandino, and
    carried on his literary studies with enthusiasm. It was probably at this time that he
    acquired the familiar knowledge of Virgil which so powerfully influenced his style,
    and that he began to form his theory of epic as distinguished from romantic poetry.
    After a residence of two years he removed to Venice, where his father was engaged in
    polishing the <i>Amadigi</i> for publication. Here a new scene of interest opened out
    for him; and here he first enjoyed the sweets of literary fame. Bernardo had been
    chosen secretary by an Academy, in which men like Veniero, Molino, Gradenigo,
    Mocenigo, and Manuzio, the most learned and the noblest Venetians, met together for
    discussion. The slim lad of fifteen was admitted to their sessions, and surprised
    these elders by his eloquence and erudition. It is noticeable that at this time he
    carefully studied and annotated Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, a poem almost neglected
    by Italians <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>{20}</span> in the
    Cinque Cento. It seemed good to his father now that he should prosecute his studies
    in earnest, with the view of choosing a more lucrative profession than that of
    letters or Court-service. Bernardo, while finishing the <i>Amadigi</i>, which he
    dedicated to Philip II., sent his son in 1560 to Padua. He was to become a lawyer
    under the guidance of Guido Panciroli. But Tasso, like Ovid, like Petrarch, like a
    hundred other poets, felt no inclination for juristic learning. He freely and frankly
    abandoned himself to the metaphysical conclusions which were being then tried between
    Piccolomini and Pendasio, the one an Aristotelian dualist, the other a materialist
    for whom the soul was not immortal. Without force of mind enough to penetrate the
    deepest problems of philosophy, Tasso was quick to apprehend their bearings. The
    Paduan school of scepticism, the logomachy in vogue there, unsettled his religious
    opinions. He began by criticising the doubts of others in his light of
    Jesuit-instilled belief; next he found a satisfaction for self-esteem in doubting
    too; finally he called the mysteries of the Creed in question, and debated the
    articles of creation, incarnation, and immortality. Yet he had not the mental vigor
    either to cut this Gordian knot, or to untie it by sound thinking. His erudition
    confused him; and he mistook the lumber of miscellaneous reading for philosophy. Then
    a reaction set in. He remembered those childish ecstasies before the Eucharist: he
    recalled the pictures of a burning hell his Jesuit <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page21" id="page21"></a>{21}</span> teachers had painted; he heard the trumpets
    of the Day of Judgment, and the sentence 'Go ye wicked!' On the brink of heresy he
    trembled and recoiled. The spirit of the coming age, the spirit of Bruno, was not in
    him. To all appearances he had not heard of the Copernican discovery. He wished to
    remain a true son of the Church, and was in fact of such stuff as the Catholic
    Revival wanted. Yet the memory of these early doubts clung to him, principally, we
    may believe, because he had not force to purge them either by severe science or by
    vivid faith. Later, when his mind was yielding to disorder, they returned in the form
    of torturing scruples and vain terrors, which his fervent but superficial pietism,
    his imaginative but sensuous religion, were unable to efface. Meanwhile, with one
    part of his mind devoted to these problems, the larger and the livelier was occupied
    with poetry. To law, the <i>Brod-Studium</i> indicated by his position in the world,
    he only paid perfunctory attention. The consequence was that before he had completed
    two years of residence in Padua, his first long poem, the <i>Rinaldo</i>, saw the
    light. In another chapter I mean to discuss the development of Tasso's literary
    theories and achievements. It is enough here to say that the applause which greeted
    the <i>Rinaldo</i>, conquered his father's opposition. Proud of its success, Bernardo
    had it printed, and Torquato in the beginning of his nineteenth year counted among
    the notable romantic poets of his country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
    id="page22"></a>{22}</span></p>
    <p>At the end of 1563, Tasso received an invitation to transfer himself from Padua to
    Bologna. This proposal came from Monsignor Cesi, who had recently been appointed by
    Pope Pius IV. to superintend public studies in that city. The university was being
    placed on a new footing, and to secure the presence of a young man already famous
    seemed desirable. An exhibition was therefore offered as an inducement; and this
    Tasso readily accepted. He spent about two years at Bologna, studying philosophy and
    literature, planning his Dialogues on the Art of Poetry, and making projects for an
    epic on the history of Godfred. Yet in spite of public admiration and official favor,
    things did not go smoothly with Tasso at Bologna. One main defect of his character,
    which was a want of tact, began to manifest itself. He showed Monsignor Cesi that he
    had a poor opinion of his literary judgment, came into collision with the pedants who
    despised Italian, and finally uttered satiric epigrams in writing on various members
    of the university. Other students indulged their humor in like pasquinades. But those
    of Tasso were biting, and he had not contrived to render himself generally popular.
    His rooms were ransacked, his papers searched; and finding himself threatened with a
    prosecution for libel, he took flight to Modena. No importance can be attached to
    this insignificant affair, except in so far as it illustrates the unlucky aptitude
    for making enemies by want of <i>savoir vivre</i> which pursued<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span> Tasso through life. His
    real superiority aroused jealousy; his frankness wounded the self-love of rivals whom
    he treated with a shadow of contempt. As these were unable to compete with him in
    eloquence, or to beat him in debate, they soothed their injured feelings by
    conspiracy and calumny against him.</p>
    <p>In an age of artifice and circumspection, while paying theoretical homage to its
    pedantries, and following the fashion of its compliments, Tasso was nothing if not
    spontaneous and heedless. This appears in the style of his letters and prose
    compositions, which have the air of being uttered from the heart. The excellences and
    defects of his poetry, soaring to the height of song and sinking into frigidity or
    baldness when the lyric impulse flags, reveal a similar quality. In conduct this
    spontaneity assumed a form of inconsiderate rashness, which brought him into
    collision with persons of importance, and rendered universities and Courts, the
    sphere of his adoption, perilous to the peace of so naturally out-spoken and
    self-engrossed a man. His irritable sensibilities caused him to suffer intensely from
    the petty vengeance of the people he annoyed; while a kind of amiable egotism blinded
    his eyes to his own faults, and made him blame fortune for sufferings of which his
    indiscretion was the cause.</p>
    <p>After leaving Bologna, Tasso became for some months house-guest of his father's
    earliest patrons, the Modenese Rangoni. With them he seems to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span> have composed his
    Dialogues upon the Art of Poetry. For many years the learned men of Italy had been
    contesting the true nature of the Epic. One party affirmed that the ancients ought to
    be followed; and that the rules of Aristotle regarding unity of plot, dignity of
    style, and subordination of episodes, should be observed. The other party upheld the
    romantic manner of Ariosto, pleading for liberty of fancy, richness of execution,
    variety of incident, intricacy of design. Torquato from his earliest boyhood had
    heard these points discussed, and had watched his father's epic, the <i>Amadigi</i>,
    which was in effect a romantic poem petrified by classical convention, in process of
    production. Meanwhile he carefully studied the text of Homer and the Latin epics,
    examined Horace and Aristotle, and perused the numerous romances of the Italian
    school. Two conclusions were drawn from this preliminary course of reading: first,
    that Italy as yet possessed no proper epic; Trissino's <i>Italia Liberata</i> was too
    tiresome, the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> too capricious; secondly, that the <i>spolia
    opima</i> in this field of art would be achieved by him who should combine the
    classic and romantic manners in a single work, enriching the unity of the antique
    epic with the graces of modern romance, choosing a noble and serious subject,
    sustaining style at a sublime altitude, but gratifying the prevalent desire for
    beauty in variety by the introduction of attractive episodes and the ornaments <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>{25}</span> of picturesque
    description. Tasso, in fact, declared himself an eclectic; and the deep affinity he
    felt for Virgil, indicated the lines upon which the Latin language in its romantic or
    Italian stage of evolution might be made to yield a second Aeneid adapted to the
    requirements of modern taste. He had, indeed, already set before himself the high
    ambition of supplying this desideratum. The note of prelude had been struck in
    <i>Rinaldo</i>; the subject of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> had been chosen. But the age in
    which he lived was nothing if not critical and argumentative. The time had long gone
    by when Dante's massive cathedral, Boccaccio's pleasure domes, Boiardo's and
    Ariosto's palaces of enchantment, arose as though unbidden and unreasoned from the
    maker's brain. It was now impossible to take a step in poetry or art without a
    theory; and, what was worse, that theory had to be exposed for dissertation and
    discussion. Therefore Tasso, though by genius the most spontaneous of men, commenced
    the great work of his life with criticism. Already acclimatized to courts, coteries,
    academies, formed in the school of disputants and pedants, he propounded his <i>Ars
    Poetica</i> before establishing it by an example. This was undoubtedly beginning at
    the wrong end; he committed himself to principles which he was bound to illustrate by
    practice. In the state of thought at that time prevalent in Italy, burdened as he was
    with an irresolute and diffident self-consciousness, Tasso <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span> could not deviate from the theory he had
    promulgated. How this hampered him, will appear in the sequel, when we come to notice
    the discrepancy between his critical and creative faculties. For the moment, however,
    the Dialogues on Epic Poetry only augmented his fame.</p>
    <p>Scipione Gonzaga, one of Tasso's firmest and most illustrious friends, had
    recently established an Academy at Padua under the name of Gli Eterei. At his
    invitation the young poet joined this club in the autumn of 1564, assumed the title
    of Il Pentito in allusion to his desertion of legal studies, and soon became the soul
    of its society. His dialogues excited deep and wide-spread interest. After so much
    wrangling between classical and romantic champions, he had transferred the contest to
    new ground and introduced a fresh principle into the discussion. This principle was,
    in effect, that of common sense, good taste and instinct. Tasso meant to say: there
    is no vital discord between classical and romantic art; both have excellences, and it
    is possible to find defects in both; pedantic adherence to antique precedent must end
    in frigid failure under the present conditions of intellectual culture; yet it cannot
    be denied that the cycle of Renaissance poetry was closed by Ariosto; let us
    therefore attempt creation in a liberal spirit, trained by both these influences. He
    could not, however, when he put this theory forward in elaborate prose, abstain from
    propositions, distinctions, deductions, and con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
    id="page27"></a>{27}</span> clusions, all of which were discutable, and each of which
    his critics and his honor held him bound to follow. In short, while planning and
    producing the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, he was involved in controversies on the very
    essence of his art. These controversies had been started by himself and he could not
    do otherwise than maintain the position he had chosen. His poet's inspiration, his
    singer's spontaneity, came thus constantly into collision with his own deliberate
    utterances. A perplexed self-scrutiny was the inevitable result, which pedagogues who
    were not inspired and could not sing, but who delighted in minute discussion, took
    good care to stimulate. The worst, however, was that he had erected in his own mind a
    critical standard with which his genius was not in harmony. The scholar and the poet
    disagreed in Tasso; and it must be reckoned one of the drawbacks of his age and
    education that the former preceded the latter in development. Something of the same
    discord can be traced in contemporary painting, as will be shown when I come to
    consider the founders of the Bolognese Academy.</p>
    <p>At the end of 1565 Tasso was withdrawn from literary studies and society in Padua.
    The Cardinal Luigi d'Este offered him a place in his household; and since this opened
    the way to Ferrara and Court-service, it was readily accepted. It would have been
    well for Tasso, at this crisis of his fate, if the line of his beloved
    Aeneid&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span></p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Heu, fuge crudeles terras, fuge littus avarum&mdash;<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>that line which warned young Savonarola away from Ferrara, had sounded in his
    ears, or met his eyes in some Virgilian <i>Sortes</i>. It would have been well if his
    father, disillusioned by the <i>Amadigi's</i> ill-success, and groaning under the
    galling yoke of servitude to Princes, had forbidden instead of encouraging this fatal
    step. He might himself have listened to the words of old Speroni, painting the Court
    as he had learned to know it, a Siren fair to behold and ravishing of song, but
    hiding in her secret caves the bones of men devoured, and 'mighty poets in their
    misery dead.' He might even have turned the pages of Aretino's <i>Dialogo delle
    Corti</i>, and have observed how the ruffian who best could profit by the vices of a
    Court, refused to bow his neck to servitude in their corruption. But no man avoids
    his destiny, because few draw wisdom from the past and none foresee the future. To
    Ferrara Tasso went with a blithe heart. Inclination, the custom of his country, the
    necessities of that poet's vocation for which he had abandoned a profession, poverty
    and ambition, vanity and the delights of life, combined to lure him to his ruin.</p>
    <p>He found Ferrara far more magnificent than Urbino. Pageants, hunting parties,
    theatrical entertainments, assumed fantastic forms of splendor in this capital, which
    no other city of Italy, except Florence and Venice upon rare occasions, rivaled.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>{29}</span> For a long while past
    Ferrara had been the center of a semi-feudal, semi-humanistic culture, out of which
    the Masque and Drama, music and painting, scholarship and poetry, emerged with
    brilliant originality, blending mediaeval and antique elements in a specific type of
    modern romance. This culminated in the permanent and monumental work began by Boiardo
    in the morning, and completed by Ariosto in the meridian of the Renaissance. Within
    the circuit of the Court the whole life of the Duchy seemed to concentrate itself.
    From the frontier of Venice to the Apennines a tract of fertile country, yielding all
    necessaries of life, corn, wine, cattle, game, fish, in abundance, poured its produce
    into the palaces and castles of the Duke. He, like other Princes of his epoch, sucked
    each province dry in order to maintain a dazzling show of artificial wealth. The
    people were ground down by taxes, monopolies of corn and salt, and sanguinary
    game-laws. Brutalized by being forced to serve the pleasures of their masters, they
    lived the lives of swine. But why repaint the picture of Italian decadence, or dwell
    again upon the fever of that phthisical consumption? Men like Tasso saw nothing to
    attract attention in the rotten state of Ferrara. They were only fascinated by the
    hectic bloom and rouged refinement of its Court. And even the least sympathetic
    student must confess that the Court at any rate was seductive. A more cunningly
    combined medley of polite culture, political astuteness, urbane learning, sumptuous
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>{30}</span> display,
    diplomatic love-intrigue and genial artistic productiveness, never before or since
    has been exhibited upon a scale so grandiose within limits so precisely
    circumscribed, or been raised to eminence so high from such inadequate foundations of
    substantial wealth. Compare Ferrara in the sixteenth with Weimar in the eighteenth
    century, and reflect how wonderfully the Italians even at their last gasp understood
    the art of exquisite existence!</p>
    <p>Alfonso II., who was always vainly trying to bless Ferrara with an heir, had
    arranged his second sterile nuptials when Tasso joined the Court in 1565. It was
    therefore at a moment of more than usual parade of splendor that the poet entered on
    the scene of his renown and his misfortune. He was twenty-one years of age; and
    twenty-one years had to elapse before he should quit Ferrara, ruined in physical and
    mental health,&mdash;<i>quantum mutatus ab illo</i> Torquato! The diffident and
    handsome stripling, famous as the author of <i>Rinaldo</i>, was welcomed in person
    with special honors by the Cardinal, his patron. Of such favors as Court-lacqueys
    prize, Tasso from the first had plenty. He did not sit at the common table of the
    serving gentlemen, but ate his food apart; and after a short residence, the
    Princesses, sisters of the Duke, invited him to share their meals. The next five
    years formed the happiest and most tranquil period of his existence. He continued
    working at the poem which had then no name, but which we know as the <i>Gerusalemme
    Liberata</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>{31}</span>
    Envies and jealousies had not arisen to mar the serenity in which he basked. Women
    contended for his smiles and sonnets. He repaid their kindness with somewhat
    indiscriminate homage and with the verses of occasion which flowed so easily from his
    pen. It is difficult to trace the history of Tasso's loves through the labyrinth of
    madrigals, odes and sonnets which belong to this epoch of his life. These
    compositions bear, indeed, the mark of a distinguished genius; no one but Tasso could
    have written them at that period of Italian literature. Yet they lack individuality
    of emotion, specific passion, insight into the profundities of human feeling. Such
    shades of difference as we perceive in them, indicate the rhetorician seeking to set
    forth his motive, rather than the lover pouring out his soul. Contrary to the
    commonly received legend, I am bound to record my opinion that love played a
    secondary part in Tasso's destinies. It is true that we can discern the silhouettes
    of some Court-ladies whom he fancied more than others. The first of these was Laura
    Peperara, for whom he is supposed to have produced some sixty compositions. The
    second was the Princess Leonora d'Este. Tasso's attachment to her has been so
    shrouded in mystery, conjecture and hair-splitting criticism, that none but a very
    rash man will pronounce confident judgment as to its real nature. Nearly the same may
    be said about his relations to her sister, Lucrezia. He has posed in literary history
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>{32}</span> as the Rizzio of
    the one lady and the Chastelard of the other. Yet he was probably in no position at
    any moment of his Ferrarese existence to be more than the familiar friend and most
    devoted slave of either. When he joined the Court, Lucrezia was ten and Leonora nine
    years his senior. Each of the sisters was highly accomplished, graceful and of royal
    carriage. Neither could boast of eminent beauty. Of the two, Lucrezia possessed the
    more commanding character. It was she who left her husband, Francesco Maria della
    Rovere, because his society wearied her, and who helped Clement VIII. to ruin her
    family, when the Papacy resolved upon the conquest of Ferrara. Leonora's health was
    sickly. For this reason she refused marriage, living retired in studies, acts of
    charity, religion, and the company of intellectual men. Something in her won respect
    and touched the heart at the same moment; so that the verses in her honor, from
    whatever pen they flowed, ring with more than merely ceremonial compliment. The
    people revered her like a saint; and in times of difficulty she displayed high
    courage and the gifts of one born to govern. From the first entrance of Tasso into
    Ferrara, the sisters took him under their protection. He lived with them on terms of
    more than courtly intimacy; and for Leonora there is no doubt that he cherished
    something like a romantic attachment. This is proved by the episode of Sofronia and
    Olindo in the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, which points in care<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page33" id="page33"></a>{33}</span> fully constructed innuendoes to his
    affection. It can even be conceded that Tasso, who was wont to indulge fantastic
    visions of unattainable greatness, may have raised his hopes so high as sometimes to
    entertain the possibility of winning her hand. But if he did dally with such dreams,
    the realities of his position must in sober moments have convinced him of their
    folly. Had not a Duchess of Amalfi been murdered for contracting a marriage with a
    gentleman of her household? And Leonora was a grand-daughter of France; and the
    cordon of royalty was being drawn tighter and tighter yearly in the Italy of his day.
    That a sympathy of no commonplace kind subsisted between this delicate and polished
    princess and her sensitively gifted poet, is apparent. But it may be doubted whether
    Tasso had in him the stuff of a grand passion. Mobile and impressible, he wandered
    from object to object without seeking or attaining permanence. He was neither a Dante
    nor a Petrarch; and nothing in his <i>Rime</i> reveals solidity of emotion. It may
    finally be said that had Leonora returned real love, or had Tasso felt for her real
    love, his earnest wish to quit Ferrara when the Court grew irksome, would be
    inexplicable. Had their <i>liaison</i> been scandalous, as some have fancied, his
    life would not have been worth two hours' Purchase either in the palace or the prison
    of Alfonso.</p>
    <p>Whatever may be thought of Tasso's love-relations to these sisters&mdash;and the
    problem is open to all conjectures in the absence of clear testimony&mdash;<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>{34}</span> it is certain that he
    owed a great deal to their kindness. The marked favor they extended to him, was worth
    much at Court: and their maturer age and wider experience enabled them to give him
    many useful hints of conduct. Thus, when he blundered into seeming rivalry with Pigna
    (the Duke's secretary, the Cecil of that little state), by praising Pigna's mistress,
    Lucrezia Bendidio, in terms of imprudent warmth, it was Leonora who warned him to
    appease the great man's anger. This he did by writing a commentary upon three of
    Pigna's leaden Canzoni, which he had the impudence to rank beside the famous three
    sisters of Petrarch's Canzoniere. The flattery was swallowed, and the peril was
    averted. Yet in this first affair with Pigna we already hear the grumbling of that
    tempest which eventually ruined Tasso. So eminent a poet and so handsome a young man
    was insupportable among a crowd of literary mediocrities and middle-aged gallants.
    Furthermore the brilliant being, who aroused the jealousies of rhymesters and of
    lovers, had one fatal failing&mdash;want of tact. In 1568, for example, he set
    himself up as a target to all malice by sustaining fifty conclusions in the Science
    of Love before the Academy of Ferrara. As he afterwards confessed, he ran the
    greatest risks in this adventure; but who, he said, could take up arms against a
    lover? Doubtless there were many lovers present; but none of Tasso's eloquence and
    skill in argument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
    id="page35"></a>{35}</span></p>
    <p>In 1569, Tasso was called to his father's sickbed at Ostiglia on the Po. He found
    the old man destitute and dying. There was not money to bury him decently; and when
    the funeral rites had been performed by the help of money-lenders, nothing remained
    to pay for a monument above his graven What the Romans called <i>pietas</i> was a
    strong feature in Torquato's character. At crises of his life he invariably appealed
    to the memory of his parents for counsel and support. When the Delia Cruscans
    attacked his own poetry, he answered them with a defense of the <i>Amadigi</i>; and
    he spent much time and pains in editing the <i>Floridante</i>, which naught but
    filial feeling could possibly have made him value at the worth of publication.</p>
    <p>In the spring of the next year, Lucrezia d'Este made her inauspicious match with
    the Duke of Urbino, Tasso's former playmate. She was a woman of thirty-four, he a
    young man of twenty-one. They did not love each other, had no children, and soon
    parted with a sense of mutual relief. In the auturmn Tasso accompanied the Cardinal
    Luigi d'Este into France, leaving his MSS. in the charge of Ercole Rondinelli. The
    document drawn up for this friend's instructions in case of his death abroad is
    interesting. It proves that the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, here called <i>Gottifredo</i>,
    was nearly finished; for Tasso wished the last six cantos and portions of the first
    two to be published. He also gave directions for collection and publication of his
    love<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>{36}</span> sonnets and
    madrigals, but requested Rondinelli to bury 'the others, whether of love or other
    matters which were written in the service of some friend,' in his grave. This last
    commission demands comment. That Tasso should have written verses to oblige a friend,
    was not only natural but consistent with custom. Light wares like sonnets could be
    easily produced by a practiced man of letters, and the friend might find them
    valuable in bringing a fair foe to terms. But why should any one desire to have such
    verses buried in his grave? The hypothesis which has been strongly urged by those who
    believe in the gravity of Tasso's <i>liaison</i> with Leonora, is that he used this
    phrase to indicate love-poems which might compromise his mistress. We cannot,
    however, do more than speculate upon the point. There is nothing to confirm or to
    refute conjecture in the evidence before us.</p>
    <p>Tasso met with his usual fortunes at the Court of Charles IX. That is to say, he
    was petted and caressed, wrote verses, and paid compliments. It was just two years
    before the Massacre of S. Bartholomew, and France presented to the eyes of earnest
    Catholics the spectacle of truly horrifying anarchy. Catherine de'Medici inclined to
    compromise matters with the Huguenots. The social atmosphere reeked with heresy and
    cynicism. In that Italianated Court, public affairs and religious questions were
    treated from a purely diplomatic point of view. Not principle, but practical
    conveni<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>{37}</span> ence ruled
    conduct and opinion. The large scale on which Machiavellism manifested itself in the
    discordant realm of France, the apparent breakdown of Catholicism as a national
    institution, struck Tasso with horror. He openly proclaimed his views, and roundly
    taxed the government with dereliction of their duty to the Church. An incurable
    idealist by temperament, he could not comprehend the stubborn actualities of
    politics. A pupil of the Jesuits, he would not admit that men like Coligny deserved a
    hearing. An Italian of the decadence, he found it hard to tolerate the humors of a
    puissant nation in a state of civil warfare. But his master, Luigi d'Este, well
    understood the practical difficulties which forced the Valois into compromise, and
    felt no personal aversion for lucrative transaction with the heretic. Though a prince
    of the Church, he had not taken priest's orders. He kept two objects in view. One was
    succession to the Duchy of Ferrara, in case Alfonso should die without heirs.<a
    name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
    class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
    <p>The other was election to the Papacy. In the latter event France, the natural ally
    of the Estensi, would be of service to him, and the Valois monarchs, his cousins,
    must therefore be supported in their policy. Tasso had been brought to Paris to look
    graceful and to write madrigals. It was inconvenient, it was unseemly, that a man of
    letters in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>{38}</span> the
    Cardinal's train should utter censures on the Crown, and should profess more Catholic
    opinions than his patron. Without the scandal of a public dismissal, it was therefore
    contrived that Tasso should return to Italy; and after this rupture, the suspicious
    poet regarded Luigi d'Este as his enemy. During his confinement in S. Anna he even
    threw the chief blame of his detention upon the Cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
    id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
    <p>After spending a short time at Rome in the company of the Cardinals Ippolito
    d'Este and Albano, Tasso returned to Ferrara in 1572. Alfonso offered him a place in
    his own household with an annual stipend worth about 88 <i>l</i>. of our money. No
    duties were attached to this post, except the delivery of a weekly lecture in the
    university. For the rest, Tasso was to prosecute his studies, polish his great poem,
    and augment the luster of the court by his accomplishments.<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
    id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It was of
    course understood that the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, when completed, should be dedicated to
    the Duke and shed its splendor on the House of Este. Who was happier than Torquato
    now? Having recently experienced the discomforts of uncongenial service, he took his
    place again upon a firmer footing in the city of his dreams. The courtiers welcomed
    him with smiles. He was once more close to Leonora, basking like Rinaldo in Armida's
    garden, with golden prospects of the fame his epic would achieve to lift him higher
    in the coming years.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>{39}</span> No wonder that
    the felicity of this moment expanded in a flower of lyric beauty which surpassed all
    that Tasso had yet published. He produced <i>Aminta</i> in the winter of 1572-3. It
    was acted with unparalleled applause; for this pastoral drama offered something
    ravishingly new, something which interpreted and gave a vocal utterance to tastes and
    sentiments that ruled the age. While professing to exalt the virtues of rusticity,
    the <i>Aminta</i> was in truth a panegyric of Court life, and Silvia reflected
    Leonora in the magic mirror of languidly luxurious verse. Poetry melted into music.
    Emotion exhaled itself in sensuous harmony. The art of the next two centuries, the
    supreme art of song, of words subservient to musical expression, had been indicated.
    This explains the sudden and extraordinary success of the <i>Aminta</i>. It was
    nothing less than the discovery of a new realm, the revelation of a specific faculty
    which made its author master of the heart of Italy. The very lack of concentrated
    passion lent it power. Its suffusion of emotion in a shimmering atmosphere toned with
    voluptuous melancholy, seemed to invite the lutes and viols, the mellow tenors, and
    the trained soprano voices of the dawning age of melody. We may here remember that
    Palestrina, seven years earlier in Rome, had already given his Mass of Pope Marcello
    to the world.</p>
    <p>Lucrezia d'Este, now Duchess of Urbino, who was anxious to share the raptures of
    <i>Aminta</i>, invited<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
    id="page40"></a>{40}</span> Tasso to Pesaro in the summer of 1573, and took him with
    her to the mountain villa of Casteldurante. She was an unhappy wife, just on the
    point of breaking her irksome bonds of matrimony. Tasso, if we may credit the
    deductions which have been drawn from passages in his letters, had the privilege of
    consoling the disappointed woman and of distracting her tedious hours. They roamed
    together through the villa gardens, and spent days of quiet in the recesses of her
    apartments. He read aloud passages from his unpublished poem, and composed sonnets in
    her honor, praising the full-blown beauty of the rose as lovelier than its budding
    charm. The duke her husband, far from resenting this intimacy, heaped favors and
    substantial gifts upon his former comrade. He had not, indeed, enough affection for
    his wife to be jealous of her. Yet it is indubitable that if he had suspected her of
    infidelity the Italian code of honor would have compelled him to make short work with
    Tasso.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"
    class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
    <p>Meanwhile it seemed as though Leonora had been forgotten by her servant. We
    possess one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>{41}</span> letter
    written to her from Casteldurante on September 3, 1573, in which he encloses a
    sonnet, disparaging it by comparison with those which he believes she has been
    receiving from another poet (Guarino probably), and saying that, though the verses
    were written, not for himself, but 'at the requisition of a poor lover, who, having
    been for some while angry with his lady, now is forced to yield and crave for
    pardon,' yet he hopes that they 'will effect the purpose he desires.'<a
    name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14"
    class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Few of Tasso's letters to Leonora have survived. This,
    therefore, is a document of much importance; and it is difficult to resist the
    conclusion that he was indirectly begging Leonora to forgive him for some piece of
    petulance or irritation. At any rate, his position between the two princesses at this
    moment was one of delicacy, in which a less vain and more cautious man than Tasso
    might have found it hard to keep his head cool.</p>
    <p>Up to the present time his life had been, in spite of poverty and domestic
    misfortunes, one almost uninterrupted career of triumph. But his fiber had been
    relaxed in the irresponsible luxurious atmosphere of Courts, and his self-esteem had
    been inflated by the honors paid to him as the first poet of his age in Europe.
    Moreover, he had been continuously over-worked and over-wrought from childhood
    onwards. Now, when he returned to Ferrara with the Duchess of Urbino at the age of
    twenty-nine, it remained to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
    id="page42"></a>{42}</span> be seen whether he could support himself with stability
    upon the slippery foundation of princely favor, whether his health would hold out,
    and whether he would be able to bring the publication of his long expected poem to a
    successful issue.</p>
    <p>In 1574 he accompanied Duke Alfonso to Venice, and witnessed the magnificent
    reception of Henri III, on his return from Poland. A fever, contracted during those
    weeks of pleasure, prevented him from working at the epic for many months. This is
    the first sign of any serious failure in Tasso's health. At the end of August 1574,
    however, the <i>Gerusalemme</i> was finished, and in the following February he began
    sending the MS. to Scipione Gonzaga at Rome. So much depended on its success, that
    doubts immediately rose within its author's mind. Will it fulfill the expectation
    raised in every Court and literary coterie of Italy? Will it bear investigation in
    the light of the Dialogues on Epic Poetry? Will the Church be satisfied with its
    morality; the Holy Office with its doctrine? None of these diffidences assailed Tasso
    when he flung <i>Aminta</i> negligently forth and found he had produced a
    masterpiece. It would have been well for him if he had turned a deaf ear to the
    doubting voice on this occasion also. But he was not of an independent character to
    start with; and his life had made him sensitively deferent to literary opinion.
    Therefore, in an evil hour, yielding to Gonzaga's advice, he resolved to submit the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i> in MS. to four <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
    id="page43"></a>{43}</span> censors&mdash;Il Borga, Flaminio de'Nobili, vulpine
    Speroni with his poisoned fang of pedantry, precise Antoniano with his inquisitorial
    prudery. They were to pass their several criticisms on the plot, characters, diction,
    and ethics of the <i>Gerusalemme</i>; Tasso was to entertain and weigh their
    arguments, reserving the right of following or rejecting their advice, but promising
    to defend his own views. To the number of this committee he shortly after added three
    more scholars, Francesco Piccolomini, Domenico Veniero, and Celio Magno.<a
    name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
    class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Not to have been half maddened by these critics would have
    proved Tasso more or less than human. They picked holes in the structure of the epic,
    in its episodes, in its theology, in its incidents, in its language, in its title.
    One censor required one alteration, and another demanded the contrary. This man
    seemed animated by an acrid spite; that veiled his malice in the flatteries of candid
    friendship. Antoniano was for cutting out the love passages: Armida, Sofronia,
    Erminia, Clorinda, were to vanish or to be adapted to conventual proprieties. It
    seemed to him more than doubtful whether the enchanted forest did not come within the
    prohibitions of the Tridentine decrees. As the revision advanced, matters grew more
    serious. Antoniano threw out some decided hints of ecclesiastical displeasure; Tasso,
    reading between the lines, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
    id="page44"></a>{44}</span> scented the style of the Collegium Germanicum.</p>
    <p>Speroni spoke openly of plagiarism&mdash;plagiarism from himself
    forsooth!&mdash;and murmured the terrible words between his teeth, 'Tasso is mad!' He
    was in fact driven wild, and told his tormentors that he would delay the publication
    of the epic, perhaps for a year, perhaps for his whole life, so little hope had he of
    its success.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> At last he resolved to compose an
    allegory to explain and moralize the poem. When he wrote the <i>Gerusalemme</i> he
    had no thought of hidden meanings; but this seemed the only way of preventing it from
    being dismembered by hypocrites and pedants.<a name="FNanchor_17_17"
    id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
    expedient proved partially successful. When Antoniano and his friends were bidden to
    perceive a symbol in the enchanted wood and other marvels, a symbol in the loves of
    heroines and heroes, a symbol even in Armida, they relaxed their wrath. The
    <i>Gerusalemme</i> might possibly pass muster now before the Congregation of the
    Index. Tasso's correspondence between March 1575 and July 1576 shows what he suffered
    at the hands of his revisers, and helps to explain the series of events which
    rendered the autumn of that latter year calamitous for him.<a name="FNanchor_18_18"
    id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> There
    are, indeed, already indications in the letters of those months that his nerves,
    enfeebled by the quartan fever under which he labored, and exasperated by carping or
    envious criticism, were overstrung.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span> Suspicions
    began to invade his mind. He complained of headache. His spirits alternated between
    depression and hysterical gayety. A dread lest the Inquisition should refuse the
    imprimatur to his poem haunted him. He grew restless, and yearned for change of
    scene.</p>
    <p>The events of 1575, 1576, and 1577 require to be minutely studied: for upon our
    interpretation of them must depend the theory which we hold of Tasso's subsequent
    misfortunes. It appears that early in the year 1575 he was becoming discontented with
    Ferrara. A party in the Court, led by Pigna, did their best to make his life there
    disagreeable. They were jealous of the poet's fame, which shone with trebled splendor
    after the production of <i>Aminta</i>. Tasso's own behavior provoked, if it did not
    exactly justify their animosity. He treated men at least his equals in position with
    haughtiness, which his irritable temper rendered insupportable. We have it from his
    own pen that 'he could not bear to live in a city where the nobles did not yield him
    the first place, or at least admit him to absolute equality'; that 'he expected to be
    adored by friends, served by serving-men, caressed by domestics, honored by masters,
    celebrated by poets, and pointed out by all.'<a name="FNanchor_19_19"
    id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
    <p>He admitted that it was his habit 'to build castles in the air of honors, favors,
    gifts and graces, showered on him by emperors and kings and mighty princes'; that
    'the slightest coldness from a patron seemed to him a tacit act of dismissal, or
    rather an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span> open act
    of violence.'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> His blood, he argued, placed him on
    a level with the aristocracy of Italy; but his poetry lifted him far above the vulgar
    herd of noblemen. At the same time, while claiming so much, he constantly declared
    himself unfit for any work or office but literary study, and expressed his opinion
    that princes ought to be his tributaries.<a name="FNanchor_21_21"
    id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Though
    such pretensions may not have been openly expressed at this period of his life, it
    cannot be doubted that Tasso's temper made him an unpleasant comrade in
    Court-service. His sensitiveness, as well as the actual slenderness of his fortunes,
    exposed him only too obviously to the malevolent tricks and petty bullyings of
    rivals. One knows what a boy of that stamp has to suffer at public schools, and a
    Court is after all not very different from an academy.</p>
    <p>Such being the temper of his mind, Tasso at this epoch turned his thoughts to
    bettering himself, as servants say. His friend Scipione Gonzaga pointed out that both
    the Cardinal de'Medici and the Grand Duke of Tuscany would be glad to welcome him as
    an ornament of their households. Tasso nibbled at the bait all through the summer;
    and in November, under the pretext of profiting by the Jubilee, he traveled to Rome.
    This journey, as he afterwards declared, was the beginning of his ruin.<a
    name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22"
    class="fnanchor">[22]</a> It was certainly one of the principal steps which led to
    the prison of S. Anna.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>{47}</span> There were many
    reasons why Alfonso should resent Tasso's entrance into other service at this moment.
    The House of Este had treated him with uniform kindness. The Cardinal, the duke and
    the princesses had severally marked him out by special tokens of esteem. In return
    they expected from him the honors of his now immortal epic. That he should desert
    them and transfer the dedication of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> to the Medici, would have
    been nothing short of an insult; for it was notorious that the Estensi and the Medici
    were bitter foes, not only on account of domestic disagreements and political
    jealousies, but also because of the dispute about precedence in their titles which
    had agitated Italian society for some time past. In his impatience to leave Ferrara,
    Tasso cast prudence to the winds, and entered into negotiations with the Cardinal
    de'Medici in Rome. When he traveled northwards at the beginning of 1576, he betook
    himself to Florence. What passed between him and the Grand Duke is not apparent. Yet
    he seems to have still further complicated his position by making political
    disclosures which were injurious to the Duke of Ferrara. Nor did he gain anything by
    the offer of his services and his poem to Francesco de'Medici. In a letter of
    February 4, 1576, the Grand Duke wrote that the Florentine visit of that fellow,
    'whether to call him a mad or an amusing and astute spirit, I hardly know,'<a
    name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
    class="fnanchor">[23]</a> had been throughout a ridiculous affair; and that nothing
    could be less convenient than his putting <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
    id="page48"></a>{48}</span> the <i>Gerusalemme</i> up to auction among princes. One
    year later, he said bluntly that 'he did not want to have a madman at his Court.'<a
    name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24"
    class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Thus Tasso, like his father, discovered that a noble poem,
    the product of his best pains, had but small substantial value. It might, indeed, be
    worth something to the patron who paid a yearly exhibition to its author; but it was
    not a gem of such high price as to be wrangled for by dukes who had the cares of
    state upon their shoulders. He compromised himself with the Estensi, and failed to
    secure a retreat in Florence.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile his enemies at Ferrara were not idle. Pigna had died in the preceding
    November. But Antonio Montecatino, who succeeded him as ducal secretary, proved even
    a more malicious foe, and poisoned Alfonso's mind against the unfortunate poet. The
    two princesses still remained his faithful friends, until Tasso's own want of tact
    alienated the sympathies of Leonora. When he returned in 1576, he found the beautiful
    Eleonora Sanvitale, Countess of Scandiano, at Court. Whether he really fell in love
    with her at first sight, or pretended to do so in order to revive Leonora d'Este's
    affection by jealousy, is uncertain.<a name="FNanchor_25_25"
    id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> At any
    rate he paid the countess such marked attentions, and wrote for her and a lady of her
    suite such splendid poetry, that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
    id="page49"></a>{49}</span> all Ferrara rang with this amour. A sonnet in Tasso's
    handwriting, addressed to Leonora d'Este and commented by her own pen, which even
    Guasti, no credulous believer in the legend of the poet's love, accepts as genuine,
    may be taken as affording proof that the princess was deeply wounded by her servant's
    conduct.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26"
    class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
    <p>It is obvious that, though Tasso's letters at this period show no signs of a
    diseased mind, his conduct began to strike outsiders as insane. Francesco de'Medici
    used the plain words <i>matto</i> and <i>pazzo</i>. The courtiers of Ferrara, some in
    pity, some in derision, muttered 'Madman,' when he passed. And he spared no pains to
    prove that he was losing self-control. In the month of January 1577, he was seized
    with scruples of faith, and conceived the notion that he ought to open his mind to
    the Holy Office. Accordingly, he appeared before the Inquisitor of Bologna, who after
    hearing his confession, bade him be of good cheer, for his self-accusations were the
    outcome of a melancholy humor. Tasso was, in fact, a Catholic molded by Jesuit
    instruction in his earliest childhood; and though, like most young students, he had
    speculated on the groundwork of theology and metaphysic, there was no taint of heresy
    or disobedience to the Church in his nature. The terror of the Inquisition was a
    morbid nightmare, first implanted in his mind by the experience of his father's
    collision with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span>
    Holy Office, enforced by Antoniano's strictures on his poem, and justified to some
    extent by the sinister activity of the institution which had burned a Carnesecchi and
    a Paleario. However it grew up, this fancy that he was suspected as a heretic took
    firm possession of his brain, and subsequently formed a main feature of his mental
    disease. It combined with the suspiciousness which now became habitual. He thought
    that secret enemies were in the habit of forwarding delations against him to
    Rome.</p>
    <p>All through these years (1575-1577) his enemies drew tighter cords around him.
    They were led and directed by Montecatino, the omnipotent persecutor, and
    hypocritical betrayer. In his heedlessness Tasso left books and papers loose about
    his rooms. These, he had good reason to suppose, were ransacked in his absence. There
    follows a melancholy tale of treacherous friends, dishonest servants, false keys,
    forged correspondence, scraps and fragments of imprudent compositions pieced together
    and brought forth to incriminate him behind his back. These arts were employed all
    through the year which followed his return to Ferrara in 1576. But they reached their
    climax in the spring of 1577. He had lost his prestige, and every servant might
    insult him, and every cur snap at his heels. Even the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, became an
    object of derision. It transpired that the revisers, to whom he had confided it, were
    picking the poem to pieces; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
    id="page51"></a>{51}</span> ignoramuses who could not scan a line, went about
    parroting their pedantries and strictures. At the beginning of 1576 Tasso had begged
    Alfonso to give him the post of historiographer left vacant by Pigna. It was his
    secret hope that this would be refused, and that so he would obtain a good excuse for
    leaving Ferrara.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But the duke granted his request. In
    the autumn of that year, one of the band of his tormentors, Maddal&ograve; de'Frecci,
    betrayed some details of his love-affairs. What these were we do not know. Tasso
    resented the insult, and gave the traitor a box on the ears in the courtyard of the
    castle. Maddal&ograve; and his brothers, after this, attacked Tasso on the piazza,
    but ran away before they reached him with their swords. They were outlawed for the
    outrage, and the duke of Ferrara, still benignant to his poet, sent him a kind
    message by one of his servants. This incident weighed on Tasso's memory. The terror
    of the Inquisition blended now with two new terrors. He conceived that his exiled
    foes were plotting to poison him. He wondered whether Maddal&ograve;'s revelations
    had reached the duke's ears, and if so, whether Alfonso would not inflict sudden
    vengeance. There is no sufficient reason, however, to surmise that Tasso's conscience
    was really burdened with a guilty secret touching Leonora d'Este. On the contrary,
    everything points to a different conclusion. His mind was simply giving way. Just as
    he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> jured up the
    ghastly specter of the Inquisition, so he fancied that the duke would murder him.
    Both the Inquisition and the duke were formidable; but the Holy Office mildly told
    him to set his morbid doubts at rest, and the duke on a subsequent occasion coldly
    wrote: 'I know he thinks I want to kill him. But if indeed I did so, it would be easy
    enough.' The duke, in fact, had no sufficient reason and no inclination to tread upon
    this insect.</p>
    <p>In June 1577, the crisis came. On the seventeenth evening of the month Tasso was
    in the apartments of the Duchess of Urbino. He had just been declaiming on the
    subject of his imaginary difficulties with the Inquisition, when something in the
    manner of a servant who passed by aroused his suspicion. He drew a knife upon the
    man&mdash;like Hamlet in his mother's bedchamber. He was immediately put under
    arrest, and confined in a room of the castle. Next day Maffeo Veniero wrote thus to
    the Grand Duke of Tuscany about the incident. 'Yesterday Tasso was imprisoned for
    having drawn a knife upon a servant in the apartment of the Duchess of Urbino. The
    intention has been to stay disorder and to cure him, rather than to inflict
    punishment. He suffers under peculiar delusions, believing himself guilty of heresy
    and dreading poison; which state of mind arises, I incline to think, from melancholic
    blood forced in upon the heart and vaporing to the brain. A wretched case, in truth,
    considering his great parts and his goodness!'<a name="FNanchor_28_28"
    id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>
    <p>Tasso was soon released, and taken by the duke his villa of Belriguardo. Probably
    this excursion was designed to soothe the perturbed spirits of the poet. But it may
    also have had a different object. Alfonso may have judged it prudent to sift the
    information laid before him by Tasso's enemies. We do not know what passed between
    them. Whether moral pressure was applied, resulting in the disclosure of secrets
    compromising Leonora d'Este, cannot now be ascertained; nor is it worth while to
    discuss the hypothesis that the Duke, in order to secure his family's honor, imposed
    on Tasso the obligation of feigning madness.<a name="FNanchor_29_29"
    id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> There is
    a something not entirely elucidated, a sediment of mystery in Tasso's fate, after
    this visit to Belriguardo, which criticism will not neglect to notice, but which no
    testing, no clarifying process of study, has hitherto explained. All we can rely upon
    for certain is that Alfonso sent him back to Ferrara to be treated physically and
    spiritually for derangement; and that Tasso thought his life was in danger. He took
    up his abode in the Convent of S. Francis, submitted to be purged, and began writing
    eloquent letters to his friends and patrons.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>{53}</span> Those which he
    addressed to the Duke of Ferrara at this crisis, weigh naturally heaviest in the
    scale of criticism.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> They turn upon his dread of the
    Inquisition, his fear of poison, and his diplomatic practice with Florence. While
    admitting 'faults of grave importance' and 'vacillation in the service of his
    prince,' he maintains that his secret foes have exaggerated these offenses, and have
    succeeded in prejudicing the magnanimous and clement spirit of Alfonso. He is
    particularly anxious about the charge of heresy. Nothing indicates that any guilt of
    greater moment weighed upon his conscience.<a name="FNanchor_31_31"
    id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> After
    scrutinizing all accessible sources of information, we are thus driven to accept the
    prosaic hypothesis that Tasso was deranged, and that his Court-rivals had availed
    themselves of a favorable opportunity for making the duke sensible of his
    insanity.</p>
    <p>After the middle of July, the Convent of S. Francis became intolerable to Tasso.
    His malady had assumed the form of a multiplex fear, which never afterwards relaxed
    its hold on his imagination. The Inquisition, the duke, the multitude of secret
    enemies plotting murder, haunted him day and night like furies. He escaped, and made
    his way, disguised in a peasant's costume, avoiding cities, harboring in mountain
    hamlets, to Sorrento.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>{54}</span> Manos, who
    wrote the history of Tasso's life in the spirit of a novelist, has painted for us a
    romantic picture of the poet in a shepherd's hut.<a name="FNanchor_32_32"
    id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> It
    recalls Erminia among the pastoral people. Indeed, the interest of that episode in
    the <i>Gerusalemme</i> is heightened by the fact that its ill-starred author tested
    the reality of his creation ofttimes in the course of this pathetic pilgrimage.
    Artists of the Bolognese Academy have placed Erminia on their canvases. But, up to
    the present time, I know of no great painter who has chosen the more striking
    incident of Tasso exchanging his Court-dress for sheepskin and a fustian jacket in
    the smoky cottage at Velletri.</p>
    <p>He reached Sorrento safely&mdash;'that most enchanting region, which at all times
    offers a delightful sojourn to men and to the Muses; but at the warm season of the
    year, when other places are intolerable, affords peculiar solace in the verdure of
    its foliage, the shadow of its woods, the lightness of the fanning airs, the
    freshness of the limpid waters flowing from impendent hills, the fertile expanse of
    tilth, the serene air, the tranquil sea, the fishes and the birds and savory fruits
    in marvelous variety; all which delights compose a garden for the intellect and
    senses, planned by Nature in her rarest mood, and perfected by art with most
    consummate curiosity.'<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Into this earthly paradise the
    wayworn pilgrim entered.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span> It was his
    birthplace; and here his sister still dwelt with her children. Tasso sought
    Cornelia's home. After a dramatic scene of suspense, he threw aside his disguise,
    declared himself to be the poet of Italy and her brother; and for a short while he
    seemed to forget Courts and schools, pedants and princes, in that genial
    atmosphere.</p>
    <p>Why did he ever leave Sorrento? That is the question which leaps to the lips of a
    modern free man. The question itself implies imperfect comprehension of Tasso's
    century and training. Outside the Court, there was no place for him. He had been
    molded for Court-life from childhood. It was not merely that he had no money;
    assiduous labor might have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
    id="page56"></a>{56}</span> supplied him with means of subsistence. But his friends,
    his fame, his habits, his ingrained sense of service, called him back to Ferrara. He
    was not simply a man, but that specific sort of man which Italians called
    <i>gentiluomo</i>&mdash;a man definitely modified and wound about with intricacies of
    association. Therefore, he soon began a correspondence with the House of Este. If we
    may trust Manso, Leonora herself wrote urgently insisting upon his return.<a
    name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34"
    class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Yet in his own letters Tasso says that he addressed
    apologies to the duke and both princesses. Alfonso and Lucrezia vouchsafed no answer.
    Leonora replied coldly that she could not help him.<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
    id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
    <p>Anyhow, Ferrara drew him back. It is of some importance here to understand Tasso's
    own feeling for the duke, his master. A few months later, after <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>{57}</span> he had once more
    experienced the miseries of Court-life, he wrote: 'I trusted in him, not as one hopes
    in men but as one trusts in God.... I was inflamed with the affection for my lord
    more than ever was man with the love of woman, and became unawares half an
    idolater.... He it was who from the obscurity of my low fortunes raised me to the
    light and reputation of the Court; who relieved me from discomforts, and placed me in
    a position of honorable ease; he conferred value on my compositions by listening to
    them when I read them, and by every mark of favor; he deigned to honor me with a seat
    at his table and with his familiar conversation; he never refused a favor which I
    begged for; lastly, at the commencement of my troubles, he showed me the affection,
    not of a master, but of a father and a brother.'<a name="FNanchor_36_36"
    id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> These
    words, though meant for publication, have the ring of truth in them. Tasso was
    actually attached to the House of Este, and cherished a vassal's loyalty for the
    duke, in spite of the many efforts which he made to break the fetters of Ferrara. At
    a distance, in the isolation and the ennui of a village, the irksomeness of those
    chains was forgotten. The poet only remembered how sweet his happier years at Court
    had been. The sentiment of fidelity revived. His sanguine and visionary temperament
    made him hope that all might yet be well.</p>
    <p>Without receiving direct encouragement from the duke, Tasso accordingly decided on
    returning.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> His sister is
    said to have dissuaded him; and he is reported to have replied that he was going to
    place himself in a voluntary prison.<a name="FNanchor_37_37"
    id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He first
    went to Rome, and opened negotiations with Alfonso's agents. In reply to their
    communications, the duke wrote upon March 22, 1578, as follows: 'We are content to
    take Tasso back; but first he must recognize the fact that he is full of melancholic
    humors, and that his old notions of enmities and persecutions are solely caused by
    the said humors. Among other signs of his disorder, he has conceived the idea that we
    want to compass his death, whereas we have always received him gladly and shown favor
    to him. It can easily be understood that if we had entertained such a fancy, the
    execution of it would have presented no difficulty. Therefore let him make his mind
    up well, before he comes, to submit quietly and unconditionally to medical treatment.
    Otherwise, if he means to scatter hints and words again as he did formerly, we shall
    not only give ourselves no further trouble about him, but if he should stay here
    without being willing to undergo a course of cure, we shall at once expel him from
    our state with the order not to return.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38"
    id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Words
    could not be plainer than these. Yet, in spite of them, such was the allurement of
    the cage for this clipped singing-bird, that Tasso went <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span> obediently back to Ferrara. Possibly he had
    not read the letter written by a greater poet on a similar occasion: 'This is not the
    way of coming home, my father! Yet if you or others find one not beneath the fame of
    Dante and his honor, that will I pursue with no slack step. But if none such give
    entrance to Florence, I will never enter Florence. How! Shall I not behold the sun
    and stars from every spot of earth? Shall I not be free to meditate the sweetest
    truths in every place beneath the sky unless I make myself ignoble, nay, ignominious
    to the people and the state of Florence? Nor truly will bread fail.' These words, if
    Tasso had remembered them, might have made his cheek blush for his own servility and
    for the servile age in which he lived. But the truth is that the fleshpots of
    Egyptian bondage enticed him; and moreover he knew, as half-insane people always
    know, that he required treatment for his mental infirmities. In his heart of hearts
    he acknowledged the justice of the duke's conditions.</p>
    <p>An Epistle or Oration addressed by Tasso to the Duke of Urbino, sets forth what
    happened after his return to Ferrara in 1578.<a name="FNanchor_39_39"
    id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
    <p>He was aware that Alfonso thought him both malicious and mad. The first of these
    opinions, which he knew to be false, he resolved to pass in silence. But he openly
    admitted the latter, 'esteeming it no disgrace to make a third to Solon and Brutus.'
    Therefore he began to act the madman even in Rome, neglecting his health, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>{60}</span> exposing himself to
    hardships, and indulging intemperately in food and wine. By these means, strange as
    it may seem, he hoped to win back confidence and prove himself a discreet servant of
    Alfonso. Soon after reaching Ferrara, Tasso thought that he was gaining ground. He
    hints that the duke showed signs of raising him to such greatness and showering
    favors upon him so abundant that the sleeping viper of Court envy stirred.
    Montecatino now persuaded his master that prudence and his own dignity indicated a
    very different line of treatment. If Tasso was to be great and honored, he must feel
    that his reputation flowed wholly from the princely favor, not from his studies and
    illustrious works. Alfonso accordingly affected to despise the poems which Tasso
    presented, and showed his will that: 'I should aspire to no eminence of intellect, to
    no glory of literature, but should lead a soft delicate and idle life immersed in
    sloth and pleasure, escaping like a runaway from the honor of Parnassus, the Lyceum
    and the Academy, into the lodgings of Epicurus, and should harbor in those lodgings
    in a quarter where neither Virgil nor Catullus nor Horace nor Lucretius himself had
    ever stayed.' This excited such indignation in the poet's breast that: 'I said
    oftentimes with open face and free speech that I would rather be a servant of any
    prince his enemy than submit to this indignity, and in short <i>odia verbis aspera
    movi</i>.' Whereupon, the duke caused his papers to be seized, in order that the
    still imperfect <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>{61}</span>
    epic might be prepared for publication by the hated hypocritical Montecatino. When
    Tasso complained, he only received indirect answers; and when he tried to gain access
    to the princesses, he was repulsed by their doorkeepers. At last: 'My infinite
    patience was exhausted. Leaving my books and writings, after the service of thirteen
    years, persisted in with luckless constancy, I wandered forth like a new Bias, and
    betook myself to Mantua, where I met with the same treatment as at Ferrara.'</p>
    <p>This account sufficiently betrays the diseased state of Tasso's mind. Being really
    deranged, yet still possessed of all his literary faculties, he affected that his
    eccentricity was feigned. The duke had formed a firm opinion of his madness; and he
    chose to flatter this whim. Yet when he arrived at Ferrara he forgot the strict
    conditions upon which Alfonso sanctioned his return, began to indulge in dreams of
    greatness, and refused the life of careless ease which formed part of the programme
    for his restoration to health. In these circumstances he became the laughing-stock of
    his detractors; and it is not impossible that Alfonso, convinced of his insanity,
    treated him like a Court-fool. Then he burst out into menaces and mutterings of
    anger. Having made himself wholly intolerable, his papers were sequestrated, very
    likely under the impression that he might destroy them or escape with them into some
    quarter where they would be used against the interests of his patron. Finally he so
    fatigued <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>{62}</span> everybody
    by his suspicions and recriminations that the duke forebore to speak with him, and
    the princesses closed their doors against him.</p>
    <p>From this moment Tasso was a ruined man; he had become that worst of social
    scourges, a courtier with a grievance, a semi-lunatic all the more dangerous and
    tiresome because his mental powers were not so much impaired as warped. Studying his
    elaborate apology, we do not know whether to despise the obstinacy of his devotion to
    the House of Este, or to respect the sentiment of loyalty which survived all real or
    fancied insults. Against the duke he utters no word of blame. Alfonso is always
    magnanimous and clement, excellent in mind and body, good and courteous by nature,
    deserving the faithful service and warm love of his dependents. Montecatino is the
    real villain. 'The princes are not tyrants&mdash;they are not, no, no: he is the
    tyrant.'<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40"
    class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
    <p>After quitting Ferrara, Tasso wandered through Mantua, Padua, Venice, coldly
    received in all these cities; for 'the hearts of men were hardened by their interests
    against him.' Writing from Venice to the Grand Duke in July, Maffeo Veniero says:
    'Tasso is here, disturbed in mind; and though his intellect is certainly not sound,
    he shows more signs of affliction than of insanity.'<a name="FNanchor_41_41"
    id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>{63}</span> The
    sequestration of his only copy of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> not unnaturally caused him
    much distress; and Veniero adds that the chief difficulty under which he labored was
    want of money. Veniero hardly understood the case. Even with a competence it is
    incredible that Tasso would have been contented to work quietly at literature in a
    private position.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> From Venice he found his way
    southward to Urbino, writing one of his sublimest odes upon the road from Pesaro.<a
    name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43"
    class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
    <p>Francesco Maria della Rovere received him with accustomed kindness; but the spirit
    of unrest drove him forth again, and after two months we find him once more, an
    indigent and homeless pedestrian, upon the banks of the Sesia. He wanted to reach
    Vercelli, but the river was in flood, and he owed a night's lodging to the chance
    courtesy of a young nobleman. Among the many picturesque episodes in Tasso's
    wanderings none is more idyllically beautiful than the tale of his meeting with this
    handsome youth. He has told it himself in the exordium to his Dialogue <i>Il Padre di
    Famiglia</i>. When asked who he was and whither he was going, he answered: 'I was
    born in the realm of Naples, and my mother was a Neapolitan; but I draw my paternal
    blood from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span> Bergamo,
    a Lombard city. My name and surname I pass in silence: they are so obscure that if I
    uttered them, you would know neither more nor less of my condition. I am flying from
    the anger of a prince and fortune. My destination is the state of Savoy.' Upon this
    pilgrimage Tasso chose the sobriquet of <i>Omero Fuggiguerra</i>. Arriving at Turin,
    he was refused entrance by the guardians of the gate. The rags upon his back made
    them suspect he was a vagabond infected with the plague. A friend who knew him,
    Angelo Ingegneri, happened to pass by, and guaranteed his respectability. Manso
    compares the journey of this penniless and haggard fugitive through the cities of
    Italy to the meteoric passage of a comet.<a name="FNanchor_44_44"
    id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Wherever
    he appeared, he blazed with momentary splendor. Nor was Turin slow to hail the
    lustrous apparition. The Marchese Filippo da Este entertained him in his palace. The
    Archbishop, Girolamo della Rovere, begged the honor of his company. The Duke of
    Savoy, Carlo Emanuele, offered him the same appointments as he had enjoyed at
    Ferrara. Nothing, however, would content his morbid spirit. Flattered and caressed
    through the months of October and November he began once more in December to hanker
    after his old home. Inconceivable as it may seem, he opened fresh negotiations with
    the duke; and Alfonso, on his side, already showed a will to take him back. Writing
    to his sister <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span> from
    Pesaro at the end of September, Tasso stay that a gentleman had been sent from
    Ferrara expressly to recall him.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The fact seems to be that Tasso was
    too illustrious to be neglected by the House of Este. Away from their protection, he
    was capable of bringing on their name the slur of bad treatment and ingratitude. Nor
    would it have looked well to publish the <i>Gerusalemme</i> with its praises of
    Alfonso, while the poet was lamenting his hard fate in every town of Italy. The
    upshot of these negotiations was that Tasso resolved on retracing his steps. He
    reached Ferrara again upon February 21, 1579, two days before Margherita Gonzaga, the
    duke's new bride, made her pompous entrance into the city. But his reception was far
    from being what he had expected. The duke's heart seemed hardened. Apartments
    inferior to his quality were assigned him, and to these he was conducted by a
    courtier with ill-disguised insolence. The princesses refused him access to their
    lodgings, and his old enemies openly manifested their derision for the kill-joy and
    the skeleton who had returned to spoil their festival. Tasso, querulous as he was
    about his own share in the disagreeables of existence, remained wholly unsympathetic
    to the trials of his fellow-creatures. Self-engrossment closed him in a magic
    prison-house of discontent.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>{66}</span> Therefore when
    he saw Ferrara full of merry-making guests, and heard the marriage music ringing
    through the courtyards of the castle, he failed to reflect with what a heavy heart
    the duke might now be entering upon his third sterile nuptials. Alfonso was
    childless, brotherless, with no legitimate heir to defend his duchy from the Church
    in case of his decease. The irritable poet forgot how distasteful at such a moment of
    forced gayety and hollow parade his reappearance, with the old complaining murmurs,
    the old suspicions, the old restless eyes, might be to the master who had certainly
    borne much and long with him. He only felt himself neglected, insulted, outraged:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i12">Questa &egrave; la data fede?<br />
        </span> <span>Son questi i miei bramati alti ritorni?<a name="FNanchor_46_46"
        id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Then he burst out into angry words, which he afterwards acknowledged to have been
    'false, mad and rash.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The duke's patience had reached its
    utmost limit. Tasso was arrested, and confined in the hospital for mad folk at S.
    Anna. This happened in March 1579. He was detained there until July 19, 1586, a
    period of seven years and four months.</p>
    <p>No one who has read the foregoing pages will wonder why Tasso was imprisoned. The
    marvel is rather that the fact should have roused so many speculations. Alfonso was
    an autocratic princeling. His favorite minister Montecatino fell in one moment from a
    height of power to irrecoverable <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
    id="page67"></a>{67}</span> ruin. The famous preacher Panigarola, for whom he
    negotiated a Cardinal's hat, lost his esteem by seeking promotion at another Court,
    and had to fly Ferrara. His friend, Ercole Contrario, was strangled in the castle on
    suspicion of having concealed a murder. Tasso had been warned repeatedly, repeatedly
    forgiven; and now when he turned up again with the same complaints and the same
    menaces, Alfonso determined to have done with the nuisance. He would not kill him,
    but he would put him out of sight and hearing. If he was guilty, S. Anna would be
    punishment enough. If he was mad, it might be hoped that S. Anna would cure him. To
    blame the duke for this exercise of authority, is difficult. Noble as is the poet's
    calling, and faithful as are the wounds of a devoted friend and servant, there are
    limits to princely patience. It is easier to blame Tasso for the incurable idealism
    which, when he was in comfort at Turin, made him pine 'to kiss the hand of his
    Highness, and recover some part of his favor on the occasion of his marriage.'<a
    name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48"
    class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
    <p>Three long letters, written by Tasso during the early months of his imprisonment,
    discuss the reasons for his arrest.<a name="FNanchor_49_49"
    id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Two of
    these are directed to his staunch friend Scipione Gonzaga, the third to Giacomo
    Buoncompagno, nephew of Pope Gregory XIII. Partly owing to omissions made by the
    editors before publication, and partly perhaps to the writer's reticence, they throw
    no very certain light <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
    id="page68"></a>{68}</span> even on his own opinion.<a name="FNanchor_50_50"
    id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> But this
    much appears tolerably clear. Tasso was half-mad and altogether irritable. He had
    used language which could not be overlooked. The Duke continued to resent his former
    practice with the Medici, and disapproved of his perpetual wanderings. The courtiers
    had done their utmost to prejudice his mind by calumnies and gossip, raking up all
    that seemed injurious to Tasso's reputation in the past acts of his life and in the
    looser verses found among his papers. It may also be conceded that they contrived to
    cast an unfavorable light upon his affectionate correspondence with the two
    princesses. Tasso himself laid great stress upon his want of absolute loyalty, upon
    some lascivious compositions, and lastly upon his supposed heresies. It is not
    probable that the duke attached importance to such poetry as Tasso may have written
    in the heat of youth; and it is certain that he regarded the heresies as part of the
    poet's hallucinations. It is also far more likely that the Leonora episode passed in
    his mind for another proof of mental infirmity than that he judged it seriously. It
    was quite enough that Tasso had put himself in the wrong by petulant abuse of his
    benefactor and by persistent fretfulness. Moreover, he was plainly <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>{69}</span> brain-sick. That alone
    justified Alfonso in his own eyes.</p>
    <p>And brain-sick Tasso was, without a shadow of doubt.<a name="FNanchor_51_51"
    id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It is
    hardly needful to recapitulate his terror of the Inquisition, dread of being
    poisoned, incapacity for self-control in word and act, and other signs of incipient
    disease. During the residence in S. Anna this malady made progress. He was tormented
    by spectral voices and apparitions. He believed himself to be under the influence of
    magic charms. He was haunted by a sprite, who stole his books and flung his MSS.
    about the room. A good genius, in the form of a handsome youth, appeared and
    conversed with him. He lost himself for hours together in abstraction, talking aloud,
    staring into vacancy, and expressing surprise that other people could not see the
    phantoms which surrounded him. He complained that his melancholy passed at moments
    into delirium (which he called <i>frenesia</i>), after which he suffered from loss of
    memory and prostration. His own mind became a constant cause of self-torture.
    Suspicious of others, he grew to be suspicious of himself. And when he left S. Anna,
    these disorders, instead of abating, continued to <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page70" id="page70"></a>{70}</span> afflict him, so that his most enthusiastic
    admirers were forced to admit that 'he was subject to constitutional melancholy with
    crises of delirium, but not to actual insanity.'<a name="FNanchor_52_52"
    id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> At first,
    his infirmity did not interfere with intellectual production of a high order, though
    none of his poetry, after the <i>Gerusalemme</i> was completed in 1574, rose to the
    level of his earlier work. But in course of time the artist's faculty itself was
    injured, and the creations of his later life are unworthy of his genius.</p>
    <p>The seven years and four months of Tasso's imprisonment may be passed over
    briefly. With regard to his so-called dungeon, it is certain that, after some months
    spent in a narrow chamber, he obtained an apartment of several rooms. He was allowed
    to write and receive as many letters as he chose. Friends paid him visits, and he
    went abroad under surveillance in the city of Ferrara. To extenuate the suffering
    which a man of his temper endured in this enforced seclusion would be unjust to
    Tasso. There is no doubt that he was most unhappy. But to exaggerate his discomforts
    would be unjust to the duke. Even Manso describes 'the excellent and most convenient
    lodgings' assigned <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span>
    him in S. Anna, alludes to the provision for his cure by medicine, and remarks upon
    the opposition which he offered to medical treatment. According to this biographer,
    his own endeavors to escape necessitated a strict watch upon his movements.<a
    name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53"
    class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Unless, therefore, we flatly deny the fact of his
    derangement, which is supported by a mass of testimony, it may be doubted whether
    Tasso was more miserable in S. Anna than he would have been at large. The subsequent
    events of his life prove that his release brought no mitigation of his malady.</p>
    <p>It was, however, a dreary time. He spent his days in writing letters to all the
    princes of Italy, to Naples, to Bergamo, to the Roman Curia, declaiming on his
    wretchedness and begging for emancipation. Occasional poems flowed from his pen. But
    during this period he devoted his serious hours mainly to prose composition. The bulk
    of his Dialogues issued from S. Anna. On August 7, 1580, Celio Malaspina published a
    portion of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> at Venice, under the title of <i>Il Gottifredo di
    M. Torquato Tasso</i>. In February of the following year, his friend Angelo Ingegneri
    gave the whole epic to the world. Within six months from that date the poem was seven
    times reissued. This happened without the sanction or the supervision of the luckless
    author; and from the sale of the book he obtained no profit. Leonora d'Este died upon
    February 10, 1581. A volume of elegies appeared <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span> on this occasion; but Tasso's Muse uttered
    no sound.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54"
    class="fnanchor">[54]</a> He wrote to Panigarola that 'a certain tacit repugnance of
    his genius' forced him to be mute.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> His rival Guarini undertook a
    revised edition of his lyrics in 1582. Tasso had to bear this dubious compliment in
    silence. All Europe was devouring his poems; scribes and versifiers were building up
    their reputation on his fame. Yet he could do nothing. Embittered by the piracies of
    publishers, infuriated by the impertinence of editors, he lay like one forgotten in
    that hospital. His celebrity grew daily; but he languished, penniless and wretched,
    in confinement which he loathed. The strangest light is cast upon his state of mind
    by the efforts which he now made to place two of his sister's children in
    Court-service. He even tried to introduce one of them as a page into the household of
    Alfonso. Eventually, Alessandro Sersale was consigned to Odoardo Farnese, and Antonio
    to the Duke of Mantua. In 1585 new sources of annoyance rose. Two members of the
    Delia Crusca Academy in Florence, Leonardo Salviati and Bastiano de'Rossi, attacked
    the <i>Gerusalemme</i>. Their malevolence was aroused by the panegyric written on it
    by Cammillo Pellegrini, a Neapolitan, and they exposed it to pedantically <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>{73}</span> quibbling criticism.
    Tasso replied in a dignified apology. But he does not seem to have troubled himself
    overmuch with this literary warfare, which served meanwhile to extend the fame of his
    immortal poem. At this time new friends gathered round him. Among these the excellent
    Benedictine, Angelo Grillo, and the faithful Antonio Costantini demand commemoration
    from all who appreciate disinterested devotion to genius in distress. At length, in
    July 1586, Vincenzo Gonzaga, heir apparent to the Duchy of Mantua, obtained Tasso's
    release. He rode off with this new patron to Mantua, leaving his effects at S. Anna,
    and only regretting that he had not waited on the Duke of Ferrara to kiss his hand as
    in duty bound.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Thus to the end he remained an
    incorrigible courtier; or rather shall we say that, after all his tribulations, he
    preserved a doglike feeling of attachment for his master?</p>
    <p>The rest of Tasso's life was an Odyssey of nine years. He seemed at first
    contented with Mantua, wrote dialogues, completed the tragedy of <i>Torrismondo</i>
    and edited his father's <i>Floridante</i>. But when Vincenzo Gonzaga succeeded to the
    dukedom, the restless poet felt himself neglected. His young friend had not leisure
    to pay him due attention. He therefore started on a journey to Loreto, which had long
    been the object of his pious aspiration. Loreto led to Rome, where Scipione Gonzaga
    resided as<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>{74}</span>
    Patriarch of Jerusalem and Cardinal. Rome suggested Southern Italy, and Tasso
    hankered after the recovery of his mother's fortune. Accordingly he set off in March
    1588 for Naples, where he stayed, partly with the monks of Monte Oliveto, and partly
    with the Marchese Manso. Rome saw him again in November; and not long afterwards an
    agent of the Duke of Urbino wrote this pitiful report of his condition. 'Every one is
    ready to welcome him to hearth and heart; but his humors render him mistrustful of
    mankind at large. In the palace of the Cardinal Gonzaga there are rooms and beds
    always ready for his use, and men reserved for his especial service. Yet he runs away
    and mistrusts even that friendly lord. In short, it is a sad misfortune that the
    present age should be deprived of the greatest genius which has appeared for
    centuries. What wise man ever spoke in prose or verse better than this madman?<a
    name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
    class="fnanchor">[57]</a> In the following August, Scipione Gonzaga's servants,
    unable to endure Tasso's eccentricities, turned him from their master's house, and he
    took refuge in a monastery of the Olivetan monks. Soon afterwards he was carried to
    the hospital of the Bergamasques. His misery now was great, and his health so bad
    that friends expected a speedy end.<a name="FNanchor_58_58"
    id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Yet the
    Cardinal Gonzaga again opened his doors to him in the spring of 1590. Then the morbid
    poet turned suspicious, and began to indulge fresh hopes of fortune <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>{75}</span> in another place. He
    would again offer himself to the Medici. In April he set off for Tuscany, and
    alighted at the convent of Monte Oliveto, near Florence. Nobody wanted him; he
    wandered about the Pitti like a spectre, and the Florentines wrote: <i>actum est de
    eo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"
    class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Some parting compliments and presents from the Grand Duke
    sweetened his dismissal. He returned to Rome; but each new journey told upon his
    broken health, and another illness made him desire a change of scene. This time
    Antonio Costantini offered to attend upon him. They visited Siena, Bologna and
    Mantua. At Mantua, Tasso made some halt, and took a new long poem, the <i>Gerusalemme
    Conquistata</i>, seriously in hand. But the demon of unrest pursued him, and in
    November 1591 he was off again with the Duke of Mantua to Rome. From Rome he went to
    Naples at the beginning of the following year, worked at the <i>Conquistata</i>, and
    began his poem of the <i>Sette Giornate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_60_60"
    id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> He was
    always occupied with the vain hope of recovering a portion of his mother's estate.
    April saw him once more upon his way to Rome. Clement VIII. had been elected, and
    Tasso expected patronage from the Papal nephews.<a name="FNanchor_61_61"
    id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span> He was not
    disappointed. They received him into their houses, and for a while he sojourned in
    the Vatican. The year 1593 seems, through their means, to have been one of
    comparative peace and prosperity. Early in the summer of 1594 his health obliged him
    to seek change of air. He went for the last time to Naples. The Cardinal of S.
    Giorgio, one of the Pope's nephews, recalled him in November to be crowned poet in
    Rome. His entrance into the Eternal City was honorable, and Clement granted him a
    special audience; but the ceremony of coronation had to be deferred because of the
    Cardinal's ill health.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile his prospects seemed likely to improve. Clement conferred on him a
    pension of one hundred ducats, and the Prince of Avellino, who had detained his
    mother's estate, compounded with him for a life-income of two hundred ducats. This
    good fortune came in the spring of 1595. But it came too late; for his death-illness
    was upon him. On the first of April he had himself transported to the convent of S.
    Onofrio, which overlooks Rome from the Janiculan hill. 'Torrents of rain were falling
    with a furious wind, when the carriage of Cardinal Cinzio was seen climbing the steep
    ascent. The badness of the weather made the fathers think there must be some grave
    cause for this arrival. So the prior and others hurried to the gate, where Tasso
    descended with considerable difficulty, greeting the monks with these words: 'I am
    come to die among <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>{77}</span>
    you.''<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"
    class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The last of Tasso's letters, written to Antonio Costantini
    from S. Onofrio, has the quiet dignity of one who struggles for the last time with
    the frailty of his mortal nature.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
    <p>'What will my good lord Antonio say when he shall hear of his Tasso's death? The
    news, as I incline to think, will not be long in coming; for I feel that I have
    reached the end of life, being unable to discover any remedy for this tedious
    indisposition which has supervened on the many others I am used to&mdash;like a rapid
    torrent resistlessly sweeping me away. The time is past when I should speak of my
    stubborn fate, to mention not the world's ingratitude, which, however, has willed to
    gain the victory of bearing me to the grave a pauper; the while I kept on thinking
    that the glory which, despite of those that like it not, this age will inherit from
    my writings, would not have left me wholly without guerdon. I have had myself carried
    to this monastery of S. Onofrio; not only because the air is commended by physicians
    above that of any other part of Rome, but also as it were upon this elevated spot and
    by the conversation of these devout fathers to commence my conversation in heaven.
    Pray God for me; and rest assured that as I have loved and honored you always in the
    present life, so will I perform for you in that other <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span> and more real life what appertains not to
    feigned but to veritable charity. And to the Divine grace I recommend you and
    myself.'</p>
    <p>On April 25, Tasso expired at midnight, with the words <i>In manus tuas,
    Domine</i>, upon his lips. Had Costantini, his sincerest friend, been there, he might
    have said like Kent:</p>

    </div>
    <p>But Costantini was in Mantua; and this sonnet, which he had written for his
    master, remains Tasso's truest epitaph, the pithiest summary of a life pathetically
    tragic in its adverse fate&mdash;</p>

    graved with the words <i>Hic jacet Torquatus Tassus</i>, marked the spot where he was
    buried.</p>
    <p>The foregoing sketch of Tasso's life and character differs in some points from the
    prevalent conceptions of the poet. There is a legendary Tasso, the victim of
    malevolent persecution by pedants, the mysterious lover condemned to misery in prison
    by a tyrannous duke. There is also a Tasso formed by men of learning upon ingeniously
    constructed systems; Rosini's Tasso, condemned to feign madness in punishment for
    courting Leonora d'Este with lascivious verses; Capponi's Tasso, punished for seeking
    to exchange the service of the House of Este for that of the House of Medici; a Tasso
    who was wholly mad; a Tasso who remained through life the victim of Jesuitical
    influences. In short, there are as many Tassos as there are Hamlets. Yet these Tassos
    of the legend and of erudition do not reproduce his self-revealed lineaments. Tasso's
    letters furnish documents of sufficient extent to make the real man visible, though
    something yet remains perhaps not wholly explicable in his tragedy.</p>

    </div>
    <p>In a previous portion of this work, I attempted to define the Italian Romantic
    Epic, and traced the tale of Orlando from Pulci through Boiardo and Ariosto to the
    burlesque of Folengo. There is an element of humor more or less predominant in the
    <i>Morgante Maggiore</i>, the <i>Orlando Innamorato</i>, and the <i>Orlando
    Furioso</i>. This element might almost be regarded as inseparable from the species.
    Yet two circumstances contributed to alter the character of Italian Romance after the
    publication of the <i>Furioso</i>. One of these was the unapproachable perfection of
    that poem. No one could hope to surpass Ariosto in his own style, or to give a fresh
    turn to his humor without passing into broad burlesque. The romantic poet <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>{81}</span> had therefore to choose
    between sinking into parody with Folengo and Aretino, or soaring into the sublimities
    of solemn art. Another circumstance was the keen interest aroused in academic circles
    by Trissino's unsuccessful epic, and by the discussion of heroic poetry which it
    stimulated. The Italian nation was becoming critical, and this critical spirit lent
    itself readily to experiments in hybrid styles of composition which aimed at
    combining the graces of the Romantic with the dignity of the Heroic poem. The most
    meritorious of these hybrids was Bernardo Tasso's <i>Amadigi</i>, a long romance in
    octave stanzas, sustained upon a grave tone throughout, and distinguished from the
    earlier romantic epics by a more obvious unity of subject. Bernardo Tasso possessed
    qualities of genius and temper which suited his proposed task. Deficient in humor, he
    had no difficulty in eliminating that element from the <i>Amadigi</i>. Chivalrous
    sentiment took the place of irony; scholarly method supplied the want of wayward
    fancy.</p>
    <p>It was just at this point that the young Torquato Tasso made his first essay in
    poetry. He had inherited his father's temperament, its want of humor, its melancholy,
    its aristocratic sensitiveness. At the age of seventeen he was already a ripe
    scholar, versed in the critical questions which then agitated learned coteries in
    Italy. The wilding graces and the freshness of the Romantic Epic, as conceived by
    Boiardo and perfected by Ariosto, had forever <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
    id="page82"></a>{82}</span> disappeared. To 'recapture that first fine careless
    rapture' was impossible. Contemporary conditions of society and thought rendered any
    attempt to do so futile. Italy had passed into a different stage of culture; and the
    representative poem of Tasso's epoch was imperatively forced to assume a different
    character. Its type already existed in the <i>Amadigi</i>, though Bernardo Tasso had
    not the genius to disengage it clearly, or to render it attractive. How Torquato,
    while still a student in his teens at Padua, attacked the problem of narrative
    poetry, appears distinctly in his preface to <i>Rinaldo</i>. 'I believe,' he says,
    'that you, my gentle readers, will not take it amiss if I have diverged from the path
    of modern poets, and have sought to approach the best among the ancients. You shall
    not, however, find that I am bound by the precise rules of Aristotle, which often
    render those poems irksome which might otherwise have yielded you much pleasure. I
    have only followed such of his precepts as do not limit your delight: for instance,
    in the frequent use of episodes, making the characters talk in their own persons,
    introducing recognitions and peripeties by necessary or plausible motives, and
    withdrawing the poet as far as possible from the narration. I have also endeavored to
    construct my poem with unity of interest and action, not, indeed, in any strict
    sense, but so that the subordinate portions should be seen to have their due relation
    to the whole.' He then proceeds to explain why he has abandoned the <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>{83}</span> discourses on moral and
    general topics with which Ariosto opened his Cantos, and hints that he has taken
    Virgil, the 'Prince of Poets,' for his model. Thus the Romantic Epic, as conceived by
    Tasso, was to break with the tradition of the Cantastorie, who told the tale in his
    own person and introduced reflections on its incidents. It was to aim at unity of
    subject and to observe classical rules of art, without, however, sacrificing the
    charm of variety and those delights which episodes and marvelous adventures yielded
    to a modern audience. The youthful poet begs that his <i>Rinaldo</i> should not be
    censured on the one hand by severely Aristotelian critics who exclude pleasure from
    their ideal, or on the other by amateurs who regard the <i>Orlando Furioso</i> as the
    perfection of poetic art. In a word, he hopes to produce something midway between the
    strict heroic epic, which had failed in Trissino's <i>Italia Liberata</i> through
    dullness, and the genuine romantic epic, which in Ariosto's masterpiece diverged too
    widely from the rules of classical pure taste. This new species, combining the
    attractions of romance with the simplicity of epic poetry, was the gift which Tasso
    at the age of eighteen sought to present in his <i>Rinaldo</i> to Italy. The
    <i>Rinaldo</i> fulfilled fairly well the conditions propounded by its author. It had
    a single hero and a single subject&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Canto i felici affanni, e i primi ardori,<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">Che giovinetto ancor soffr&igrave; Rinaldo,<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">E come il trasse in perigliosi errori<br />
        </span> <span class="i2">Desir di gloria ed amoroso caldo.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span> The perilous
    achievements and the passion of Rinaldo in his youth form the theme of a poem which
    is systematically evolved from the first meeting of the son of Amon with Clarice to
    their marriage under the auspices of Malagigi. There are interesting episodes like
    those of young Florindo and Olinda, unhappy Clizia and abandoned Floriana. Rinaldo's
    combat with Orlando in the Christian camp furnishes an anagnorisis; while the plot is
    brought to its conclusion by the peripeteia of Clarice's jealousy and the accidents
    which restore her to her lover's arms. Yet though observant of his own classical
    rules, Tasso remained in all essential points beneath the spell of the Romantic Epic.
    The changes which he introduced were obvious to none but professional critics. In
    warp and woof the <i>Rinaldo</i> is similar to Boiardo's and Ariosto's tale of
    chivalry; only the loom is narrower, and the pattern of the web less intricate. The
    air of artlessness which lent its charm to Romance in Italy has disappeared, yielding
    place to sustained elaboration of Latinizing style. Otherwise the fabric remains
    substantially unaltered&mdash;like a Gothic dwelling furnished with Palladian
    window-frames. We move in the old familiar sphere of Paladins and Paynims, knights
    errant and Oriental damsels, magicians and distressed maidens. The action is impelled
    by the same series of marvelous adventures and felicitous mishaps. There are the same
    encounters in war and rivalries in love between Christian and Pagan champions;
    journeys through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span>
    undiscovered lands and over untracked oceans; fantastic hyperboles of desire,
    ambition, jealousy, and rage, employed as motive passions. Enchanted forests; fairy
    ships that skim the waves without helm or pilot; lances endowed with supernatural
    virtues; charmed gardens of perpetual spring; dismal dungeons and glittering palaces,
    supply the furniture of this romance no less than of its predecessors. Rinaldo, like
    any other hero of the Renaissance, is agitated by burning thirst for fame and blind
    devotion to a woman's beauty. We first behold him pining in inglorious leisure<a
    name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64"
    class="fnanchor">[64]</a>:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">

    <p>The vision of Clarice, appearing like Virgil's Camilla, stirs him from this
    lethargy. He falls in love at first sight, as Tasso's heroes always do, and vows to
    prove himself her worthy knight by deeds of unexampled daring. Thus the plot is put
    in motion; and we read in well-appointed order how the hero acquired his horse,
    Baiardo, Tristram's magic lance, his sword Fusberta from Atlante, his armor from
    Orlando, the trappings of his charger from the House of Courtesy, the ensign of the
    lion rampant on his shield from Chiarello, and the hand of his lady after some delays
    from Malagigi.</p>
    <p>No new principle is introduced into the romance.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page86" id="page86"></a>{86}</span> As in earlier poems of this species, the
    religious motive of Christendom at war with Islam becomes a mere machine; the
    chivalrous environment affords a vehicle for fanciful adventures. Humor, indeed, is
    conspicuous by its absence. Charles the Great assumes the sobriety of empire; and his
    camp, in its well-ordered gravity, prefigures that of Goffredo in the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i>.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Thus Tasso's originality must not be
    sought in the material of his work, which is precisely that of the Italian romantic
    school in general, nor yet in its form, which departs from the romantic tradition in
    details so insignificant as to be inessential. We find it rather in his touch upon
    the old material, in his handling of the familiar form. The qualities of style,
    sympathy, sentiment, selection in the use of phrase and image, which determined his
    individuality as a poet, rendered the <i>Rinaldo</i> a novelty in literature. It will
    be therefore well to concentrate attention for a while upon those subjective
    peculiarities by right of which the <i>Rinaldo</i> ranks as a precursor of the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i>.</p>
    <p>The first and the most salient of these is a pronounced effort to heighten style
    by imitation of Latin poets. The presiding genius of the work is Virgil. Pulci's racy
    Florentine idiom; Boiardo's frank and natural Lombard manner; Ariosto's transparent
    and unfettered modern phrase, have been supplanted by a pompous intricacy of
    construction.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span> The effort to
    impose Latin rules of syntax on Italian is obvious in such lines as the following:<a

    <p>This Virgilian imitation yields some glowing flowers of poetry in longer passages
    of description. Among these may be cited the conquest of Baiardo in the second canto,
    the shipwreck in the tenth, the chariot of Pluto in the fourth, and the supper with
    queen Floriana in the ninth.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span> The episode of
    Floriana, while closely studied upon the Aeneid, is also a first sketch for that of
    Armida. Indeed, it should be said in passing that Tasso anticipates the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i> throughout the <i>Rinaldo</i>. The murder of Anselmo by Rinaldo
    (Canto XI.) forecasts the murder of Gernando by his namesake, and leads to the same
    result of the hero's banishment. The shipwreck, the garden of courtesy, the enchanted
    boat, and the charmed forest, are motives which reappear improved and elaborated in
    Tasso's masterpiece.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>
    <p>While Tasso thus sought to heighten diction by Latinisms, he revealed another
    specific quality of his manner in <i>Rinaldo</i>. This is the inability to sustain
    heroic style at its ambitious level. He frequently drops at the close of the octave
    stanza into a prosaic couplet, which has all the effect of bathos. Instances are not
    far to seek:<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a

    <p>If the <i>Rinaldo</i> prefigures Tasso's maturer qualities of style, it is no less
    conspicuous for the light it throws upon his eminent poetic faculty. Nothing
    distinguished him more decidedly from the earlier romantic poets than power over
    pathetic sentiment conveyed in melodious cadences of oratory. This emerges in
    Clarice's monologue on love and honor, that combat of the soul which forms a main
    feature of the lyrics in <i>Aminta</i> and of Erminia's episode in the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> This steeps the whole story of

    emotion through sound into modulated verse.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>{90}</span> That lyrical
    outcry, finding rhythmic utterance for tender sentiment, which may be recognized as
    Tasso's chief addition to romantic poetry, pierces like a song through many passages
    of mere narration. Rinaldo, while carrying Clarice away upon Baiardo, with no chaste
    intention in his heart, bids her thus dry her tears:<a name="FNanchor_74_74"

    <p>It is not that we do not find similar lyrical interbreathings in the narrative of
    Ariosto. But Tasso developed the lyrism of the octave stanza into something special,
    lulling the soul upon gentle waves of rising and falling rhythm, foreshadowing the
    coming age of music in cadences that are untranslateable except by vocal melody. In
    like manner, the idyl, which had played a prominent part in Boiardo's and in
    Ariosto's romance, detaches itself with a peculiar sweetness from the course of
    Tasso's narrative. This appears in the story of Florindo, which contains within
    itself the germ of the <i>Aminta</i>, the <i>Pastor Fido</i> and the <i>Adone</i>.<a
    name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"
    class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Together with the bad taste of the artificial pastoral, its
    preposterous costume (stanza 13), its luxury of tears (stanza 23), we find the
    tyranny of kisses (stanzas 28, 52), the yearning after the Golden<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>{91}</span> Age (stanza 29), and all
    the other apparatus of that operatic species. Tasso was the first poet to bathe
    Arcady in a golden afternoon light of sensuously sentimental pathos. In his idyllic
    as in his lyrical interbreathings, melody seems absolutely demanded to interpret and
    complete the plangent rhythm of his dulcet numbers. Emotion so far predominates over
    intelligence, so yearns to exhale itself in sound and shun the laws of language, that
    we find already in <i>Rinaldo</i> Tasso's familiar <i>Non so che</i> continually used
    to adumbrate sentiments for which plain words are not indefinite enough.</p>
    <p>The <i>Rinaldo</i> was a very remarkable production for a young man of eighteen.
    It showed the poet in possession of his style and displayed the specific faculties of
    his imagination. Nothing remained for Tasso now but to perfect and develop the type
    of art which he had there created. Soon after his first settlement in Ferrara, he
    began to meditate a more ambitious undertaking. His object was to produce the heroic
    poem for which Italy had long been waiting, and in this way to rival or surpass the
    fame of Ariosto. Trissino had chosen a national subject for his epic; but the
    <i>Italia Liberata</i> was an acknowledged failure, and neither the past nor the
    present conditions of the Italian people offered good material for a serious poem.
    The heroic enthusiasms of the age were religious. Revived Catholicism had assumed an
    attitude of defiance. The Company of Jesus was declaring its crusade <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>{92}</span> against heresy and
    infidelity throughout the world. Not a quarter of a century had elapsed since Charles
    V. attacked the Mussulman in Tunis; and before a few more years had passed, the
    victory of Lepanto was to be won by Italian and Spanish navies. Tasso, therefore,
    obeyed a wise instinct when he made choice of the first crusade for his theme, and of
    Godfrey of Boulogne for his hero. Having to deal with historical facts, he studied
    the best authorities in chronicles, ransacked such books of geography and travel as
    were then accessible, paid attention to topography, and sought to acquire what we now
    call local coloring for the details of his poem. Without the sacrifice of truth in
    any important point, he contrived to give unity to the conduct of his narrative,
    while interweaving a number of fictitious characters and marvelous circumstances with
    the historical personages and actual events of the crusade. The vital interest of the
    <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> flows from this interpolated material, from the loves of
    Rinaldo and Tancredi, from the adventures of the Pagan damsels Erminia, Armida and
    Clorinda. The <i>Gerusalemme</i> is in truth a Virgilian epic, upon which a romantic
    poem has been engrafted. Goffredo, idealized into statuesque frigidity, repeats the
    virtues of Aeneas; but the episode of Dido, which enlivens Virgil's hero, is
    transferred to Rinaldo's part in Tasso's story. The battles of Crusaders and Saracens
    are tedious copies of the battle in the tenth Aeneid; but the duels of Tancredi <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>{93}</span> with Clorinda and
    Argante breathe the spirit and the fire of chivalry. The celestial and infernal
    councils, adopted as machinery, recall the rival factions in Olympus; but the force
    by which the plot moves is love. Pluto and the angel Gabriel are inactive by
    comparison with Armida, Erminia and Clorinda. Tasso in truth thought that he was
    writing a religious and heroic poem. What he did write, was a poem of sentiment and
    passion&mdash;a romance. Like Anacreon he might have cried:</p>
   <div class="center">
   <img src="images/greek.jpg"
      alt="thel&ocirc; legein Atreidas, ha barbitos de chordais Er&ocirc;ta mounon &ecirc;chei."
      title="thel&ocirc; legein Atreidas, thel&ocirc; de Kadmon adein, ha barbitos de chordais,

   </div>

   <h5>(thel&ocirc; legein Atreidas, thel&ocirc; de Kadmon adein, ha barbitos de chordais
    Er&ocirc;ta mounon &ecirc;chei.)</h5>

    <p>He displayed, indeed, marvelous ingenuity and art in so connecting the two strains
    of his subject, the stately Virgilian history and the glowing modern romance, that
    they should contribute to the working of a single plot. Yet he could not succeed in
    vitalizing the former, whereas the latter will live as long as human interest in
    poetry endures. No one who has studied the <i>Gerusalemme</i> returns with pleasure
    to Goffredo, or feels that the piety of the Christian heroes is inspired. He skips
    canto after canto dealing with the crusade, to dwell upon those lyrical outpourings
    of love, grief, anguish, vain remorse and injured affection which the supreme poet of
    sentiment has invented for his heroines; he recognizes the genuine inspiration of
    Erminia's pastoral idyl, of Armida's sensuous charms, of Clorinda's dying words,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> of the Siren's
    song and the music of the magic bird: of all, in fact, which is not pious in the
    poem.</p>
    <p>Tancredi, between Erminia and Clorinda, the one woman adoring him, the other
    beloved by him&mdash;the melancholy graceful modern Tancredi, Tasso's own soul's
    image&mdash;is the veritable hero of the <i>Gerusalemme</i>; and by a curious
    unintended propriety he disappears from the action before the close, without a word.
    The force of the poem is spiritualized and concentrated in Clorinda's death, which
    may be cited as an instance of sublimity in pathos. It is idyllized in the episode of
    Erminia among the shepherds, and sensualized in the supreme beauty of Armida's
    garden. Rinaldo is second in importance to Tancredi; and Goffredo, on whom Tasso
    bestows the blare of his Virgilian trumpet from the first line to the last, is
    poetically of no importance whatsoever. Argante, Solimano, Tisaferno, excite our
    interest, and win the sympathy we cannot spare the saintly hero; and in the death of
    Solimano Tasso's style, for once, verges upon tragic sublimity.</p>
    <p>What Tasso aimed at in the <i>Gerusalemme</i> was nobility. This quality had not
    been prominent in Ariosto's art. If he could attain it, his ambition to rival the
    <i>Orlando Furioso</i> would be satisfied. One main condition of success Tasso
    brought to the achievement. His mind itself was eminently noble, incapable of
    baseness, fixed on fair and worthy objects of contemplation. Yet the personal
    nobility which distinguished him as a thinker and a man, was <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page95" id="page95"></a>{95}</span> not of the heroic type. He had nothing
    Homeric in his inspiration, nothing of the warrior or the patriot in his nature. His
    genius, when it pursued its bias, found instinctive utterance in elegy and idyl, in
    meditative rhetoric and pastoral melody. In order to assume the heroic strain, Tasso
    had recourse to scholarship, and gave himself up blindly to the guidance of Latin
    poets. This was consistent with the tendency of the Classical Revival; but since the
    subject to be dignified by epic style was Christian and mediaeval, a discord between
    matter and manner amounting almost to insincerity resulted. Some examples will make
    the meaning of this criticism more apparent. When Goffredo rejects the embassy of
    Atlete and Argante, he declares his firm intention of delivering Jerusalem in spite
    of overwhelming perils. The crusaders can but perish:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Noi morirem, ma non morremo inulti. (i. 86.)<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This of course is a reminiscence of Dido's last words, and the difference between
    the two situations creates a disagreeable incongruity. The nod of Jove upon Olympus
    is translated to express the fiat of the Almighty (xiii. 74); Gabriel is tricked out
    in the plumes and colors of Mercury (i. 13-15); the very angels sinning round the
    throne become 'dive sirene' (xiv. 9); the armory of heaven is described in terms
    which reduce Michael's spear and the arrows of pestilence to ordinary weapons (vii.
    81); Hell is filled with harpies, centaurs, hydras, pythons, the com<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>{96}</span> mon lumber of classical
    Tartarus (iv. 5); the angel sent to cure Goffredo's wound culls dittany on Ida (xi.
    72); the heralds, interposing between Tancredi and Argante, hold pacific scepters and
    have naught of chivalry (vi. 51). It may be said that both Dante before Tasso, and
    Milton after him, employed similar classical language in dealing with Christian and
    mediaeval motives. But this will hardly serve as an excuse; for Dante and Milton
    communicate so intense a conviction of religious earnestness that their Latinisms,
    even though incongruous, are recognized as the mere clothing of profoundly felt
    ideas. The sublimity, the seriousness, the spiritual dignity is in their thought, not
    in its expression; whereas Tasso too frequently leaves us with the certainty that he
    has sought by ceremonious language to realize more than he could grasp with the
    imagination. In his council of the powers of hell, for instance, he creates monsters
    of huge dimensions and statuesque distinctness; but these are neither grotesquely
    horrible like Dante's, nor are they spirits with incalculable capacity for evil like
    Milton's.</p>

    <p>Against this we have to place the dreadful scene of Satan with his angels
    transformed to snakes (<i>Par. Lost</i>, x. 508-584), and the Dantesque horror of
    the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>{97}</span> 'vermo reo che

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>we feel that the Latin phrase is accidental. The spirit of the poet remains
    profoundly Christian. Tasso's Jehovah-Jupiter is always 'il Re del Ciel'; and the
    court of blessed spirits which surrounds his 'gran seggio,' though described with
    solemn pomp of phrase, cannot be compared with the Mystic Rose of Paradise (ix.
    55-60). What Tasso lacks is authenticity of vision; and his heightened style only
    renders this imaginative poverty, this want of spiritual conviction, more
    apparent.</p>
    <p>His frequent borrowings from Virgil are less unsuccessful when the matter to be
    illustrated is not of this exalted order. Many similes (vii. 55, vii. 76, viii. 74)
    have been transplanted with nice propriety. Many descriptions, like that of the
    approach of night (ii-96), of the nightingale mourning for her young (xii. 90), of
    the flying dream (xiv. 6), have been translated with exquisite taste. Dido's
    impassioned apostrophe to Aeneas reappears appropriately upon Armida's lips (xvi.
    56). We welcome such culled phrases as the following:</p>

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>It may, however, be observed that in the last of these passages Tasso does not
    show a just discriminative faculty. Turnus said:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i17">Non me tua fervida terrent<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>From Jupiter to Amor is a descent from sublimity to pathos. In like manner when

      <div class="stanza">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>the reminiscence suggests ideas that are unfavorable to the modern version.</p>
    <p>In his description of battles, the mustering of armies, and military operations,
    Tasso neither draws from mediaeval sources nor from experience, but imitates the
    battle-pieces of Virgil and Lucan, sometimes with fine rhetorical effect and
    sometimes with wearisome frigidity. The death of Latino and his five sons is both
    touching in itself, and a good example of this Virgilian mannerism (ix. 35). The
    death of Dudone is justly celebrated as a sample of successful imitation (iii.
    45):</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Cade; e gli occhi, ch'appena aprir si ponno,<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>{99}</span> The wound of
    Gerniero, on the contrary, illustrates the peril of seeking after conceits in the
    inferior manner of the master (ix. 69):</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>La destra di Gerniero, onde ferita<br />
        </span> <span>Ella fu pria, manda recisa al piano;<br />

        </span> <span>Semiviva nel suol guizza la mano.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The same may be said about the wound of Algaz&egrave;l (ix. 78) and the death of
    Ardonio (xx. 39). In the description of the felling of the forest (iii. 75, 76) and
    of the mustering of the Egyptian army (xvii. 1-36) Tasso's Virgilian style attains
    real grandeur and poetic beauty.</p>
    <p>Tasso was nothing if not a learned poet. It would be easy to illustrate what he
    has borrowed from Lucretius, or to point out that the pathos of Clorinda's apparition
    to Tancredi after death is a debt to Petrarch. It may, however, suffice here to
    indicate six phrases taken straight from Dante; since the <i>Divine Comedy</i> was
    little studied in Tasso's age, and his selection of these lines reflects credit on
    his taste. These are:</p>

    proclivities betrayed him into vio<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
    id="page100"></a>{100}</span> lation of the clear Italian language. Afraid of what is
    natural and common, he produced what is artificial and conceited. Hence came involved
    octaves like the following (vi. 109):</p>
    <div class="poem">

    <p>The image is beautiful; but the diction is elaborately intricate, rhetorically
    indistinct. We find the same stylistic involution in these lines (xii. 6):</p>

    <p>The limpid well of native utterance is troubled at its source by scholastic
    artifices in these as in so many other passages of Tasso's masterpiece. Nor was he
    yet emancipated from the weakness of <i>Rinaldo</i>. Trying to soar upon the borrowed
    plumes of pseudo-classical sublimity, he often fell back wearied by this uncongenial
    effort into prose. Lame endings to stanzas, sudden descents from highly-wrought to
    pedestrian diction, are not uncommon in the <i>Gerusalemme</i>. The poet, diffident
    of his own inspiration, sought inspiration from books. In the magnificence of single
    lines again, the <i>Gerusalemme</i> reminds us of <i>Rinaldo</i>. Tasso gained
    dignity of rhythm by choos<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
    id="page101"></a>{101}</span> ing Latin adjectives and adverbs with pompous cadences.
    No versifier before his date had consciously employed the sonorous music of such

    <p>The last of these lines presents an impressive landscape in three melodious
    words.</p>
    <p>These verbal and stylistic criticisms are not meant to cast reproach on Tasso as a
    poet. If they have any value, it is the light they throw upon conditions under which
    the poet was constrained to work. Humanism and the Catholic Revival reduced this
    greatest genius of his age to the necessity of clothing religious sentiments in
    scholastic phraseology, with the view of attaining to epic grandeur. But the Catholic
    Revival was no regeneration of Christianity from living sources; and humanism had run
    its course in Italy, and was ending in the sands of critical self-consciousness. Thus
    piety in Tasso appears superficial and conventional rather than profoundly felt or
    originally vigorous; while the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
    id="page102"></a>{102}</span> scholarship which supplied his epic style is scrupulous
    and timid.</p>
    <p>The enduring qualities of Tasso as a modern poet have still to be indicated; and
    to this more grateful portion of my argument I now address myself. Much might be said
    in the first place about his rhetorical dexterity&mdash;the flexibility of language
    in his hands, and the copiousness of thought, whereby he was able to adorn varied
    situations and depict diversity of passions with appropriate diction. Whether Alete
    is subtly pleading a seductive cause, or Goffredo is answering his sophistries with
    well-weighed arguments; whether Pluto addresses the potentates of hell, or Erminia
    wavers between love and honor; whether Tancredi pours forth the extremity of his
    despair, or Armida heaps reproaches on Rinaldo in his flight; the musical and
    luminously polished stanzas lend themselves without change of style to every
    gradation of the speaker's mood. In this art of rhetoric, Tasso seems to have taken
    Livy for his model; and many of his speeches which adorn the graver portions of his
    poem are noticeable for compact sententious wisdom.</p>
    <p>In fancy Tasso was not so naturally rich and inventive as the author of <i>Orlando
    Furioso</i>. Yet a gallery of highly-finished pictures might be collected from his
    similes and metaphors. What pride and swiftness mark this vision of a
    thunderbolt:</p>

    <p>Flowers furnish the poet with exquisite suggestions of color:</p>

    <p>I will content myself with referring to the admirably conceived simile of a bulky
    galleon at sea attacked by a swifter and more agile vessel (xix. 13), which may
    perhaps have suggested to Fuller his famous comparison of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson
    in their wit encounters.</p>
    <p>But Tasso was really himself, incomparable and unapproachable, when he wrote in
    what musicians would call the <i>largo e maestoso</i> mood.</p>

    <p>This is perfect in its measured melancholy, the liquid flow of its majestic
    simplicity. The same musical breadth, the same noble sweetness, pervade a passage on

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This verbal music culminates in the two songs of earthly joy, the <i>chants
    d'amour</i>, or hymns to pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
    id="page105"></a>{105}</span> ure, sung by Armida's ministers (xiv. 60-65, xvi. 12,
    13). Boiardo and Ariosto had painted the seductions of enchanted gardens, where valor
    was enthralled by beauty, and virtue dulled by voluptuous delights. It remained for
    Tasso to give that magic of the senses vocal utterance. From the myrtle groves of
    Orontes, from the spell-bound summer amid snows upon the mountains of the Fortunate
    Isle, these lyrics with their penetrative sweetness, their lingering regret, pass
    into the silence of the soul. It is eminently characteristic of Tasso's mood and age
    that the melody of both these honeyed songs should thrill with sadness. Nature is at
    war with honor; youth passes like a flower away; therefore let us love and yield our
    hearts to pleasure while we can. <i>Sehnsucht</i>, the soul of modern sentiment, the
    inner core of modern music, makes its entrance into the sphere of art with these two
    hymns. The division of the mind, wavering between natural impulse and acquired
    morality, gives the tone of melancholy to the one chant. In the other, the invitation
    to self-abandonment is mingled with a forecast of old age and death. Only Catullus,
    in his song to Lesbia, among the ancients touched this note; only Villon, perhaps, in
    his Ballade of Dead Ladies, touched it among the moderns before Tasso. But it has
    gone on sounding ever since through centuries which have enjoyed the luxury of grief
    in music.</p>
    <p>If Tancredi be the real hero of the <i>Gerusalemme</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page106" id="page106"></a>{106}</span> Armida is the heroine. The action of the
    epic follows her movements. She combines the parts of Angelica and Alcina in one that
    is original and novel. A sorceress, deputed by the powers of hell to defeat the arms
    of the crusaders, Armida falls herself in love with a Christian champion. Love
    changes her from a beautiful white witch into a woman.<a name="FNanchor_76_76"
    id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> When she
    meets Rinaldo in the battle, she discharges all her arrows vainly at the man who has
    deserted her. One by one, they fly and fall; and as they wing their flight, Love
    wounds her own heart with his shafts:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Scocca I' arco pi&ugrave; volte, e non fa piaga<br />
        </span> <span>E, mentre ella saetta, amor lei piaga (xx. 65).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Then she turns to die in solitude. Rinaldo follows, and stays her in the suicidal
    act. Despised and rejected as she is, she cannot hate him. The man she had entangled
    in her wiles has conquered and subdued her nature. To the now repentant minister of
    hell he proposes baptism; and Armida consents:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>S&igrave; parla, e prega; e i preghi bagna e scalda<br />
        </span> <span>Or di lagrime rare, or di sospiri:<br />
        </span> <span>Onde, siccome suol nevosa falda<br />
        </span> <span>Dov'arde il sole, o tepid' aura spiri,<br />
        </span> <span>Cos&igrave; l'ira che in lei parea s&igrave; salda,<br />
        </span> <span>Solvesi, e restan sol gli altri desiri.<br />
        </span> <span><i>Ecco l'ancilla tua</i>; d'essa a tuo senno<br />
        </span> <span>Dispon, gli disse, e le fia legge il cenno (xx. 136).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This metamorphosis of the enchantress into the woman in Armida, is the climax of
    the <i>Gerusalemme</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
    id="page107"></a>{107}</span> It is also the climax and conclusion of Italian
    romantic poetry, the resolution of its magic and marvels into the truths of human
    affection. Notice, too, with what audacity Tasso has placed the words of Mary on the
    lips of his converted sorceress! Deliberately planning a religious and heroic poem,
    he assigns the spoils of conquered hell to love triumphant in a woman's breast.
    Beauty, which in itself is diabolical, the servant of the lords of Hades, attains to
    apotheosis through affection. In Armida we already surmise <i>das ewig Weibliche</i>
    of Goethe's Faust, Gretchen saving her lover's soul before Madonna's throne in
    glory.</p>
    <p>What was it, then, that Tasso, this 'child of a later and a colder age,' as
    Shelley called him, gave of permanent value to European literature? We have seen that
    the <i>Gerusalemme</i> did not fulfill the promise of heroic poetry for that
    eminently unheroic period. We know that neither the Virgilian hero nor the
    laboriously developed theme commands the interest of posterity. We feel that
    religious emotion is feeble here, and that the classical enthusiasm of the
    Renaissance is on the point of expiring in those Latinistic artifices. Yet the
    interwoven romance contains a something difficult to analyze, intangible and
    evanescent&mdash;<i>un non so che</i>, to use the poet's favorite phrase&mdash;which
    riveted attention in the sixteenth century, and which harmonizes with our own
    sensibility to beauty. Tasso, in one word, was the poet, not of passion, not of
    humor, not of piety, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
    id="page108"></a>{108}</span> not of elevated action, but of that new and undefined
    emotion which we call Sentiment. Unknown to the ancients, implicit in later mediaeval
    art, but not evolved with clearness from romance, alien to the sympathies of the
    Renaissance as determined by the Classical Revival, sentiment, that <i>non so che</i>
    of modern feeling, waited for its first apocalypse in Tasso's work. The phrase which
    I have quoted, and which occurs so frequently in this poet's verse, indicates the
    intrusion of a new element into the sphere of European feeling. Vague, indistinct,
    avoiding outline, the phrase <i>un non so che</i> leaves definition to the instinct
    of those who feel, but will not risk the limitation of their feeling by submitting it
    to words. Nothing in antique psychology demanded a term of this kind. Classical
    literature, in close affinity to sculpture, dealt with concrete images and conscious
    thoughts. The mediaeval art of Dante, precisely, mathematically measured, had not
    felt the need of it. Boccaccio's clear-cut intaglios from life and nature, Petrarch's
    compassed melodies, Poliziano's polished arabesques, Ariosto's bright and many
    colored pencilings, were all of them, in all their varied phases of Renaissance
    expression, distinguished by decision and firmness of drawing. Vagueness, therefore,
    had hitherto found no place in European poetry or plastic art. But music, the supreme
    symbol of spiritual infinity in art, was now about to be developed; and the specific
    touch of Tasso, the musician-poet, upon portraiture and <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page109" id="page109"></a>{109}</span> feeling, called forth this quality of
    vagueness, a vagueness that demanded melody to give what it refused from language to
    accept. Mendelssohn when some one asked him what is meant by music, replied that it
    had meanings for his mind more unmistakable than those which words convey; but what
    these meanings were, he did not or he could not make clear. This certainty of
    sentiment, seeming vague only because it floats beyond the scope of language in
    regions of tone and color and emotion, is what Tasso's <i>non so che</i> suggests to
    those who comprehend. And Tasso, by his frequent appeal to it, by his migration from
    the plastic into the melodic realm of the poetic art, proved himself the first
    genuinely sentimental artist of the modern age. It is just this which gave him a
    wider and more lasting empire over the heart through the next two centuries than that
    claimed by Ariosto.</p>
    <p>It may not be unprofitable to examine in detail Tasso's use of the phrase to which
    so much importance has been assigned in the foregoing paragraph. We meet it first in
    the episode of Olindo and Sofronia. Sofronia, of all the heroines of the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i>, is the least interesting, notwithstanding her magnanimous
    mendacity and Jesuitical acceptance of martyrdom. Olindo touches the weaker fibers of
    our sympathy by his feminine devotion to a woman placed above him in the moral scale,
    whose love he wins by splendid falsehood equal to her own. The episode, entirely idle
    in the action <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span>
    of the poem, has little to recommend it, if we exclude the traditionally accepted
    reference to Tasso's love for Leonora d'Este. But when Olindo and Sofronia are
    standing, back to back, against the stake, Aladino, who has decreed their death by
    burning, feels his rude bosom touched with sudden pity:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Un non so che d'inusitato e molle<br />
        </span> <span>Par che nel duro petto al re trapasse:<br />
        </span> <span>Ei presentillo, e si sdegn&ograve;; n&egrave; voile<br />
        </span> <span>Piegarsi, e gli occhi torse, e si ritrasse (ii. 37).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The intrusion of a lyrical emotion, unknown before in the tyrant's breast, against
    which he contends with anger, and before the force of which he bends, prepares us for
    the happy <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> brought about by Clorinda. This vague stirring of
    the soul, this <i>non so che</i>, this sentiment, is the real agent in Sofronia's
    release and Olindo's beatification.</p>
    <p>Clorinda is about to march upon her doom. She is inflamed with the ambition to
    destroy the engines of the Christian host by fire at night; and she calls Argante to
    her counsels:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Buona pezza &egrave;, signor, che in s&egrave; raggira<br />

        </span> <span>La mia mente inquieta; o Dio l'inspira,<br />
        </span> <span>O l'uom del suo voler suo Dio si face (xii. 5).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Thus at this solemn point of time, when death is certainly in front, when she
    knows not whether God has inspired her or whether she has made of her own wish a
    deity, Clorinda utters the mystic word of vague compulsive feeling.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>{111}</span></p>
    <p>Erminia, taken captive by Tancredi after the siege of Antioch, is brought into her
    master's tent. He treats her with chivalrous courtesy, and offers her a knight's
    protection:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Allora un non so che soave e piano<br />
        </span> <span>Sentii, ch'al cor mi scese, e vi s'affisse,<br />
        </span> <span>Che, serpendomi poi per l'alma vaga,<br />
        </span> <span>Non so come, divenne incendio e piaga (xix. 94).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>At that moment, by the distillation of that vague emotion into vein and marrow,
    Erminia becomes Tancredi's slave, and her future is determined.</p>
    <p>These examples are, perhaps, sufficient to show how Tasso, at the turning-points
    of destiny for his most cherished personages, invoked indefinite emotion to adumbrate
    the forces with which will contends in vain. But the master phrase rings even yet
    more tyrannously in the passage of Clorinda's death, which sums up all of sentiment
    included in romance. Long had Tancredi loved Clorinda. Meeting her in battle, he
    stood her blows defenseless; for Clorinda was an Amazon, reduced by Tasso's gentle
    genius to womanhood from the proportions of Marfisa. Finally, with heart surcharged
    with love for her, he has to cross his sword in deadly duel with this lady. Malign
    stars rule the hour: he knows not who she is: misadventure makes her, instead of him,
    the victim of their encounter. With her last breath she demands baptism&mdash;the
    good Tasso, so it seems, could not send so fair a creature of his fancy as Clorinda
    to the shades without <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
    id="page112"></a>{112}</span> viaticum; and his poetry rises to the sublime of pathos
    in this stanza:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i2">Amico, hai vinto: io ti perdon: perdona<br />
        </span> <span>Tu ancora: al corpo no, che nulla pave;<br />
        </span> <span>All'alma s&igrave;: deh! per lei prega; e dona<br />
        </span> <span>Battesmo a me ch'ogni mia colpa lave.<br />
        </span> <span>In queste voci languide risuona<br />
        </span> <span>Un non so che di flebile e soave<br />
        </span> <span>Ch'al cor gli serpe, ed ogni sdegno ammorza,<br />
        </span> <span>E gli occhi a lagrimar gl'invoglia e sforza (xii. 66).<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Here the vague emotion, the <i>non so che</i>, distils itself through Clorinda's
    voice into Tancredi's being. Afterwards it thrills there like moaning winds in an
    Aeolian lyre, reducing him to despair upon his bed of sickness, and reasserting its
    lyrical charm in the vision which he has of Clorinda among the trees of the enchanted
    forest. He stands before the cypress where the soul of his dead lady seems to his
    misguided fancy prisoned; and the branches murmur in his ears:</p>
    <div class="poem">

        </span> <span>Par d'umani sospiri e di singulti;<br />
        </span> <span>E un non so che confuso instilla al core<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The master word, the magic word of Tasso's sentiment, is uttered at this moment of
    illusion. The poet has no key to mysteries locked up within the human breast more
    powerful than this indefinite <i>un non so che</i>.</p>
    <p>Enough has been said to show how Tasso used the potent spell of vagueness, when he
    found himself <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>{113}</span>
    in front of supreme situations. This is in truth the secret of his mastery over
    sentiment, the spell whereby he brings nature and night, the immense solitudes of
    deserts, the darkness of forests, the wailings of the winds and the plangent litanies
    of sea-waves into accord with overstrained humanity. It was a great discovery; by
    right of it Tasso proved himself the poet of the coming age.</p>
    <p>When the <i>Gerusalemme</i> was completed, Tasso had done his best work as a poet.
    The misfortunes which began to gather round him in his thirty-first year, made him
    well-nigh indifferent to the fate of the poem which had drained his life-force, and
    from which he had expected so much glory. It was published without his permission or
    supervision. He, meanwhile, in the prison of S. Anna, turned his attention to prose
    composition. The long series of dialogues, with which he occupied the irksome leisure
    of seven years, interesting as they are in matter and genial in style, indicate that
    the poet was now in abeyance. It remained to be seen whether inspiration would revive
    with freedom. No sooner were the bolts withdrawn than his genius essayed a fresh
    flight. He had long meditated the composition of a tragedy, and had already written
    some scenes. At Mantua in 1586-7 this work took the form of <i>Torrismondo</i>. It
    cannot be called a great drama, for it belongs to the rigid declamatory species of
    Italian tragedy; and Tasso's genius was romantic, idyllic, elegiac, anything but
    genuinely tragic. Yet the style is eminent for no<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> bility and purity. Just as the
    <i>Aminta</i> showed how unaffected Tasso could be when writing without preconceived
    theories of heightened diction, so the <i>Torrismondo</i> displays an unstrained
    dignity of simple dialogue. It testifies to the plasticity of language in the hands
    of a master, who deliberately chose and sustained different styles in different
    species of poetry, and makes us regret that he should have formed his epic manner
    upon so artificial a type. The last chorus of <i>Torrismondo</i> deserves to be
    mentioned as a perfect example of Tasso's melancholy elegiac pathos.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile he began to be dissatisfied with the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, and in 1588 he
    resolved upon remodeling his masterpiece. The real vitality of that poem was, as we
    have seen, in its romance. But Tasso thought otherwise. During the fourteen years
    which elapsed since its completion, the poet's youthful fervor had been gradually
    fading out. Inspiration yielded to criticism; piety succeeded to sentiment and
    enthusiasm for art. Therefore, in this later phase of his maturity, with powers
    impaired by prolonged sufferings and wretched health, tormented by religious scruples
    and vague persistent fear, he determined to eliminate the romance from the epic, to
    render its unity of theme more rigorous, and to concentrate attention upon the
    serious aspects of the subject. The result of this plan, pursued through five years
    of wandering, was the <i>Gerusalemme Conquistata</i>, a poem which the world has
    willingly let <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span>
    die, in which the style of the <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> is worsened, and which now
    serves mainly to establish by comparison the fact that what was immortal in Tasso's
    art was the romance he ruthlessly rooted out. A further step in this transition from
    art to piety is marked by the poem upon the Creation of the World, called <i>Le Sette
    Giornate</i>. Written in blank verse, it religiously but tamely narrates the
    operation of the Divine Artificer, following the first chapter of Genesis and
    expanding the motive of each of the seven days with facile rhetoric. Of action and of
    human interest the poem has none; of artistic beauty little. The sustained
    descriptive style wearies; and were not this the last work of Tasso, it would not be
    mentioned by posterity.</p>
    <p>Tasso has already occupied us through two chapters. Before passing onward I must,
    however, invite the reader to pause awhile and reconsider, even at the risk of
    retrospect and repetition, some of the salient features of his character. And now I
    remember that of his personal appearance nothing has hitherto been said. 'Tasso was
    tall, well-proportioned, and of very fair complexion. His thick hair and beard were
    of a light-brown color. His head was large, forehead broad and square, eyebrows dark,
    eyes large, lively and blue, nose large and curved toward the mouth, lips thin and
    pale.' So writes Manso, the poet's friend and biographer, adding: 'His voice was
    clear and sonorous; but he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
    id="page116"></a>{116}</span> read his poems badly, because of a slight impediment in
    his speech, and because he was short-sighted.' I know not whether I am justified in
    drawing from this description the conclusion that Tasso was, physically, a man of
    mixed lymphatic and melancholic temperament, of more than ordinary sensitiveness.
    Imperfection, at any rate, is indicated by the thin pale lips, the incoherent
    utterance and the uncertain vision to which his friend in faithfulness bears witness.
    Of painted portraits representing Tasso in later life there are many; but most of
    these seem to be based upon the mask taken from his face after death, which still
    exists at S. Onofrio. Twenty-one years ago I gazed upon this mask, before I knew then
    more than every schoolboy knows of Tasso's life and writings. This is what I wrote
    about it in my Roman diary: 'The face is mild and weak, especially in the thin short
    chin and feeble mouth.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The forehead round, and ample in
    proportion to the other features. The eyes are small, but this may be due to the
    contraction of death. The mouth is almost vulgar, very flat in the upper lip; but
    this also ought perhaps to be attributed to the relaxation of tissue by death.</p>
    <p>Tasso was constitutionally inclined to pensive moods. His outlook over life was
    melancholy.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78"
    class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>{117}</span> The tone of
    his literary work, whether in prose or poetry, is elegiac&mdash;musically, often
    querulously plaintive. There rests a shadow of dejection over all he wrote and
    thought and acted. Yet he was finely sensitive to pleasure, thrillingly alive to
    sentimental beauty.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Though the man lived purely,
    untainted by the license of the age, his genius soared highest when he sang some soft
    luxurious strain of love. He was wholly deficient in humor. Taking himself and the
    world of men and things too much in earnest, he weighed heavily alike on art and
    life. The smallest trifles, if they touched him, seemed to him important.<a
    name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80"
    class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Before imaginary terrors he shook like an aspen. The
    slightest provocation roused his momentary resentment. The most insignificant sign of
    neglect or coldness wounded his self-esteem. Plaintive, sensitive to beauty,
    sentimental, tender, touchy, self-engrossed, devoid of humor&mdash;what a sentient
    instrument was this for uttering Aeolian melodies, and straining discords through
    storm-jangled strings!</p>
    <p>From the Jesuits, in childhood, he received religious impressions which might
    almost be described as mesmeric or hypnotic in their influence upon his nerves. These
    abode with him through manhood; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
    id="page118"></a>{118}</span> and in later life morbid scruples and superstitious
    anxieties about his soul laid hold on his imagination. Yet religion did not penetrate
    Tasso's nature. As he conceived it, there was nothing solid and supporting in its
    substance. Piety was neither deeply rooted nor indigenous, neither impassioned nor
    logically reasoned, in the adult man.<a name="FNanchor_81_81"
    id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> What it
    might have been, but for those gimcrack ecstasies before the Host in boyhood, cannot
    now be fancied. If he contained the stuff of saint or simple Christian, this was
    sterilized and stunted by the clever fathers in their school at Naples.</p>
    <p>During the years of his feverishly active adolescence Tasso played for a while
    with philosophical doubts. But though he read widely and speculated diffusely on the
    problems of the universe, he failed to pierce below the surface of the questions
    which he handled. His own beliefs had been tested in no red-hot crucible, before he
    recoiled with terror from their analysis. The man, to put it plainly, was incapable
    of honest revolt against the pietistic fashions of his age, incapable of exploratory
    efforts, and yet too intelligent to rest satisfied with gross dogmatism or smug
    hypocrisy. Neither as a thinker, nor as a Christian, nor yet again as that epicene
    religious being, a Catholic of the Counter-Reformation, did this noble and ingenuous,
    but weakly nature attain to thoroughness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"
    id="page119"></a>{119}</span></p>
    <p>Tasso's mind was lively and sympathetic; not penetrative, not fitted for forming
    original or comprehensive views. He lived for no great object, whether political,
    moral, religious, or scientific. He committed himself to no vice. He obeyed no
    absorbing passion of love or hatred. In his misfortunes he displayed the helplessness
    which stirs mere pity for a prostrate human being. The poet who complained so
    querulously, who wept so copiously, who forgot offense so nonchalantly, cannot
    command admiration.</p>
    <p>There is nothing sublimely tragic in Tasso's suffering. The sentiment inspired by
    it is that at best of pathos. An almost childish self-engrossment restricted his
    thoughts, his aims and aspirations, to a narrow sphere, within which he wandered
    incurably idealistic, pursuing prosaic or utilitarian objects&mdash;the favor of
    princes, place at Courts, the recovery of his inheritance&mdash;in a romantic and
    unpractical spirit.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Vacillating, irresolute, peevish, he
    roamed through all the towns of Italy, demanding more than sympathy could give,
    exhausting friendship, changing from place to place, from lord to lord. Yet how
    touching was the destiny of this laureled exile, this brilliant wayfarer on the
    highroads of a world he never understood! Shelley's phrase, 'the world's rejected
    guest' exactly seems to suit him.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>{120}</span> And yet he
    allowed himself to become the spoiled child of his misfortunes. Without them, largely
    self-created as they were, Tasso could not now appeal to our hearts. Nor does he
    appeal to us as Dante, eating the salt bread of patrons' tables, does; as Milton,
    blind and fallen on evil days; as Chatterton, perishing in pride and silence; as
    Johnson, turning from the stairs of Chesterfield; as Bruno, averting stern eyes from
    the crucifix; as Leopardi, infusing the virus of his suffering into the veins of
    humanity; as Heine, motionless upon his mattress grave. These more potent
    personalities, bequeathing to the world examples of endurance, have won the wreath of
    never-blasted bays which shall not be set on Tasso's forehead. We crown him with
    frailer leaves, bedewed with tears tender as his own sentiment, and aureoled with the
    light that emanates from pure and delicate creations of his fancy.</p>
    <p>Though Tasso does not command admiration by heroism, he wins compassion as a
    beautiful and finely-gifted nature inadequate to cope with the conditions of his
    century. For a poet to be independent in that age of intellectual servitude was
    well-nigh impossible. To be light-hearted and ironically indifferent lay not in
    Tasso's temperament. It was no less difficult for a man of his mental education to
    maintain the balance between orthodoxy and speculation, faith and reason, classical
    culture and Catholicism, the Renaissance and the Counter-Reformation. He belonged in
    one sense too much, and in another <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
    id="page121"></a>{121}</span> sense too little, to his epoch. One eminent critic
    calls him the only Christian of the Italian Renaissance, another with equal justice
    treats him as the humanistic poet of the Catholic Revival.<a name="FNanchor_83_83"
    id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>
    <p>Properly speaking, he was the genius of that transition from the Renaissance to
    the Counter-Reformation, on which I dwelt in the second chapter of this work. By
    natural inclination he belonged to the line of artists which began with Boccaccio and
    culminated in Ariosto. But his training and the bias of the times in which he lived,
    made him break with Boccaccio's tradition. He tried to be the poet of the Council of
    Trent, without having assimilated hypocrisy or acquired false taste, without
    comprehending the essentially prosaic and worldly nature of that religious
    revolution. He therefore lived and worked in a continual discord. This may not
    suffice to account for the unhingement of his reason. I prefer to explain that by the
    fatigue of intellectual labor and worry acting on a brain predisposed for melancholia
    and overtasked from infancy. But it does account for the moral martyrdom he suffered,
    and the internal perplexity to which he was habitually subject.</p>
    <p>When Tasso first saw the light, the Italians had rejected the Reformation and
    consented to stifle free thought. The culture of the Renaissance had been condemned;
    the Spanish hegemony had been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
    id="page122"></a>{122}</span> accepted. Of this new attitude the concordat between
    Charles and Clement, the Tridentine Council, the Inquisition and the Company of Jesus
    were external signs. But these potent agencies had not accomplished their work in
    Tasso's lifetime. He was rent in twain because he could not react against them as
    Bruno did, and could not identify himself with them as Loyola was doing. As an artist
    he belonged to the old order which was passing, as a Christian to the new order which
    was emerging. His position as a courtier, when the Augustan civility of the earlier
    Medici was being superseded by dynastic absolutism, complicated his difficulties.
    While accepting service in the modern spirit of subjection, he dreamed of masters who
    should be Maecenases, and fondly imagined that poets might still live, like Petrarch,
    on terms of equality with princes.</p>
    <p>We therefore see in Tasso one who obeyed influences to which his real self never
    wholly or consciously submitted. He was not so much out of harmony with his age as
    the incarnation of its still unharmonized contradictions. The pietism instilled into
    his mind at Naples; the theories of art imbibed at Padua and Venice; the classical
    lumber absorbed during his precocious course of academical studies; the hypocritical
    employment of allegory to render sensuous poetry decorous; the deference to critical
    opinion and the dictates of literary lawgivers; the reverence for priests and princes
    interposed between <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
    id="page123"></a>{123}</span> the soul and God: these were principles which Tasso
    accepted without having properly assimilated and incorporated their substance into
    his spiritual being. What the poet in him really was, we perceive when he wrote, to
    use Dante's words, as Love dictates; or as Plato said, when he submitted to the mania
    of the Muse; or as Horace counseled, when he indulged his genius. It is in the
    <i>Aminta</i>, in the episodes of the <i>Gerusalemme</i>, in a small percentage of
    the <i>Rime</i>, that we find the true Tasso. For the rest, he had not the advantages
    enjoyed by Boiardo and Ariosto in a less self-conscious age, of yielding to natural
    impulse after a full and sympathetic study of classical and mediaeval sources. The
    analytical labors of the previous century hampered his creativeness. He brought to
    his task preoccupations of divers and self-contradictory pedantries&mdash;pedantries
    of Catholicism, pedantries of scholasticism, pedantries of humanism in its exhausted
    phase, pedantries of criticism refined and subtilized within a narrow range of
    problems. He had, moreover, weighing on his native genius the fears which brooded
    like feverish exhalations over the evil days in which he lived&mdash;fears of
    Church-censure, fears of despotic princes, fears of the Inquisition, fears of hell,
    fears of the judgment of academies, fears of social custom and courtly
    conventionalities. Neither as poet nor as man had he the courage of originality. What
    he lacked was character. He obeyed the spirit of his age, in so far as he did not,
    like young David, decline Saul's <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
    id="page124"></a>{124}</span> armor and enter into combat with Philistinism, wielding
    his sling and stone of native force alone. Yet that native force was so vigorous
    that, in spite of the panoply of prejudice he wore, in spite of the cumbrous armor
    lent him by authority, he moved at times with superb freedom. In those rare intervals
    of personal inspiration he dictated the love-tales of Erminia and Armida, the
    death-scene of Clorinda, the pastoral of Aminta and Silvia&mdash;episodes which
    created the music and the painting of two centuries, and which still live upon the
    lips of the people. But inasmuch as his genius labored beneath the superincumbent
    weight of precedents and deferences, the poet's nature was strained to the uttermost
    and his nervous elasticity was overtaxed. No sooner had he poured forth freely what
    flowed freely from his soul, than he returned on it with scrupulous analysis. The
    product of his spirit stood before him as a thing to be submitted to opinion, as a
    substance subject to the test of all those pedantries and fears. We cannot wonder
    that the subsequent conflict perplexed his reason and sterilized his creative faculty
    to such an extent that he spent the second half of his life in attempting to undo the
    great work of his prime. The <i>Gerusalemme Conquistata</i> and the <i>Sette
    Giornate</i> are thus the splendid triumph achieved by the feebler over the stronger
    portions of his nature, the golden tribute paid by his genius to the evil genius of
    the age controlling him. He was a poet who, had he lived in the days of Ariosto,
    would <span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>{125}</span> have
    created in all senses spontaneously, producing works of Virgilian beauty and divine
    melancholy to match the Homeric beauty and the divine irony of his great peer. But
    this was not to be. The spirit of the times which governed his education, with which
    he was not revolutionary enough to break, which he strove as a critic to assimilate
    and as a social being to obey, destroyed his independence, perplexed his judgment,
    and impaired his nervous energy. His best work was consequently of unequal value;
    pure and base metal mingled in its composition. His worst was a barren and lifeless
    failure.</p>

    </div>
    <p>The humanistic and artistic impulses of the Renaissance were at the point of
    exhaustion in Italy. Scholarship declined; the passion for antiquity expired. All
    those forms of literature which Boccaccio initiated&mdash;comedy, romance, the idyl,
    the lyric and the novel&mdash;had been worked out by a succession of great writers.
    It became clear that the nation was not destined to create tragic or heroic types of
    poetry. Architecture, sculpture and painting had performed their task of developing
    mediaeval motives by the light of classic models, and were now entering on the stage
    of academical inanity. Yet the mental vigor of the Italians was by no means
    exhausted. Early in the sixteenth century Machiavelli had in<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> augurated a new method for political
    philosophy; Pompanazzo at Padua and Telesio at Cosenza disclosed new horizons for
    psychology and the science of nature. It seemed as though the Renaissance in Italy
    were about to assume a fresh and more serious character without losing its essential
    inspiration. That evolution of intellectual energy which had begun with the
    assimilation of the classics, with the first attempts at criticism, with the
    elaboration of style and the perfection of artistic form, now promised to invade the
    fields of metaphysical and scientific speculation. It is true, as we have seen, that
    the theological problems of the German Reformation took but slight hold on Italians.
    Their thinkers were already too far advanced upon the paths of modern rationalism to
    feel the actuality of questions which divided Luther from Zwingli, Calvin from
    Servetus, Knox from Cranmer. But they promised to accomplish master-works of
    incalculable magnitude in wider provinces of exploration and investigation. And had
    this progress not been checked, Italy would have crowned and completed the process
    commenced by humanism. In addition to the intellectual culture already given to
    Europe, she might have revealed right methods of mental analysis and physical
    research. For this further step in the discovery of man and of the world, the nation
    was prepared to bring an army of new pioneers into the field&mdash;the philosophers
    of the south, and the physicists of the Lombard universities.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span></p>
    <p>Humanism effected the emancipation of intellect by culture. It called attention to
    the beauty and delightfulness of nature, restored man to a sense of his dignity, and
    freed him from theological authority. But in Italy, at any rate, it left his
    conscience, his religion, his sociological ideas, the deeper problems which concern
    his relation to the universe, the subtler secrets of the world in which he lives,
    untouched.</p>
    <p>These <i>novi homines</i> of the later Renaissance, as Bacon called them, these
    <i>novatori</i>, as they were contemptuously styled in Italy, prepared the further
    emancipation of the intellect by science. They asserted the liberty of thought and
    speech, proclaimed the paramount authority of that inner light or indwelling deity
    which man owns in his brain and breast, and rehabilitated nature from the stigma cast
    on it by Christianity. What the Bible was for Luther, that was the great Book of
    Nature for Telesio, Bruno, Campanella. The German reformer appealed to the reason of
    the individual as conscience; the school of southern Italy made a similar appeal to
    intelligence. In different ways Luther and these speculative thinkers maintained the
    direct illumination of the human soul by God, man's immediate dependence on his
    Maker, repudiating ecclesiastical intervention, and refusing to rely on any principle
    but earnest love of truth.</p>
    <p>Had this new phase of the Italian Renaissance been permitted to evolve itself
    unhindered, there is no saying how much earlier Europe might have entered into the
    possession of that kingdom of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"
    id="page129"></a>{129}</span> unprejudiced research which is now secured for us. But
    it was just at the moment when Italy became aware of the arduous task before her,
    that the Catholic reaction set in with all its rigor. The still creative spirit of
    her children succumbed to the Inquisition, the Congregation of the Index, the decrees
    of Trent, the intellectual submission of the Jesuits, the physical force of Spanish
    tyranny, and Roman absolutism. Carnesecchi was burned alive; Paleario was burned
    alive; Bruno was burned alive: these three at Rome. Vanini was burned at Toulouse.
    Valentino Gentile was executed by Calvinists at Berne. Campanella was cruelly
    tortured and imprisoned for twenty-seven years at Naples. Galileo was forced to
    humble himself before ignorant and arrogant monks, and to hide his head in a country
    villa. Sarpi felt the knife of an assassin, and would certainly have perished at the
    instigation of his Roman enemies but for the protection guaranteed him by the Signory
    of Venice. In this way did Italy&mdash;or rather, let us say, the Church which
    dominated Italy&mdash;devour her sons of light. It is my purpose in the present
    chapter to narrate the life of Bruno and to give some account of his philosophy,
    taking him as the most illustrious example of the school exterminated by reactionary
    Rome.</p>
    <p>Giordano Bruno was born in 1548 at Nola, an ancient Greek city close to Naples. He
    received the baptismal name of Filippo, which he exchanged for Giordano on assuming
    the Dominican habit. His <span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
    id="page130"></a>{130}</span> parents, though people of some condition, were poor;
    and this circumstance may perhaps be reckoned the chief reason why Bruno entered the
    convent of S. Dominic at Naples before he had completed his fifteenth year. It will
    be remembered that Sarpi joined the Servites at the age of thirteen, and Campanella
    the Dominicans at that of fourteen. In each of these memorable cases it is probable
    that poverty had something to do with deciding a vocation so premature. But there
    were other inducements, which rendered the monastic life not unattractive, to a young
    man seeking knowledge at a period and in a district where instruction was both costly
    and difficult to obtain. Campanella himself informs us that he was drawn to the order
    of S. Dominic by its reputation for learning and by the great names of S. Thomas
    Aquinas and Albertus Magnus. Bruno possibly felt a similar attraction; for there is
    nothing in the temper of his mind to make us believe that he inclined seriously to
    the religious life of the cloister.</p>
    <p>During his novitiate he came into conflict with the superiors of his convent for
    the first time. It was proved against him that he had given away certain images of
    saints, keeping only the crucifix; also that he had told a comrade to lay aside a
    rhymed version of the Seven Joys of Mary, and to read the lives of the Fathers of the
    Church instead. On these two evidences of insufficient piety, an accusation was
    prepared against him which might have led to serious <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page131" id="page131"></a>{131}</span> results. But the master of the novices
    preferred to destroy the document, retaining only a memorandum of the fact for future
    use in case of need.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Bruno, after this event, obeyed the
    cloistral discipline in quiet, and received priest's orders in 1572.</p>
    <p>At this epoch of his life, when he had attained his twenty-fourth year, he visited
    several Dominican convents of the Neapolitan province, and entered with the want of
    prudence which was habitual to him into disputations on theology. Some remarks he let
    fall on transubstantiation and the Divinity of Christ, exposed him to a suspicion of
    Arianism, a heresy at that time rife in southern Italy. Bruno afterwards confessed
    that from an early age he had entertained speculative doubts upon the metaphysics of
    the Trinity, though he was always prepared to accept that dogma in faith as a good
    Catholic. The Inquisition took the matter up in earnest, and began to institute
    proceedings of so grave a nature that the young priest felt himself in danger. He
    escaped in his monk's dress, and traveled to Rome, where he obtained admittance for a
    short while to the convent of the Minerva.</p>
    <p>We know very little what had been his occupations up to this date. It is only
    certain that he had already composed a comedy, <i>Il Candelajo</i>: which furnishes
    sufficient proof of his familiarity with mundane manners. It is, in fact, one of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> freest and most
    frankly satirical compositions for the stage produced at that epoch, and reveals a
    previous study of Aretino. Nola, Bruno's birthplace, was famous for the license of
    its country folk. Since the day of its foundation by Chalkidian colonists, its
    inhabitants had preserved their Hellenic traditions intact. The vintage, for example,
    was celebrated with an extravagance of obscene banter, which scandalized Philip II.'s
    viceroy in the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> During the period of Bruno's
    novitiate, the ordinances of the Council of Trent for discipline in monasteries were
    not yet in operation; and it is probable that throughout the thirteen years of his
    conventual experience, he mixed freely with the people and shared the pleasures of
    youth in that voluptuous climate. He was never delicate in his choice of phrase, and
    made no secret of the admiration which the beauty of women excited in his nature. The
    accusations brought against him at Venice contained one article of indictment
    implying that he professed distinctly profligate opinions; and though there is
    nothing to prove that his private life was vicious, the tenor of his philosophy
    favors more liberty of manners than the Church allowed in theory to her ministers.<a
    name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86"
    class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>{133}</span> It is of
    some importance to dwell on this topic; for Bruno's character and temper, so markedly
    different from that of Sarpi, for example, affected in no small measure the form and
    quality of his philosophy. He was a poet, gifted with keen and lively sensibilities,
    open at all pores to the delightfulness of nature, recoiling from nothing that is
    human. At no period of his life was he merely a solitary thinker or a student of
    books. When he came to philosophize, when the spiritual mistress, Sophia, absorbed
    all other passions in his breast, his method of exposition retained a tincture of
    that earlier phase of his experience.</p>
    <p>It must not be thought, however, that Bruno prosecuted no serious studies during
    this period. On the contrary, he seems to have amassed considerable erudition in
    various departments of learning: a fact which should make us cautious against
    condemning conventual education as of necessity narrow and pedantic. When he left
    Naples, he had acquired sufficient knowledge of Aristotle and the Schoolmen, among
    whom he paid particular attention to S. Thomas and to Raymond Lully. Plato, as
    expounded by Plotinus, had taken firm hold on his imagination. He was versed in the
    dialectics of the previous age, had mastered mediaeval cosmography and mathematics,
    and was probably already acquainted with Copernicus. The fragments of the Greek
    philosophers, especially of Pythagoras and Parmenides, whose metaphysics powerfully
    influenced his mind, had been assimilated. Perhaps the writ<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page134" id="page134"></a>{134}</span> ings of Cardinal Cusa, the theologian
    who applied mathematics to philosophy, were also in his hands at the same period.
    Beside Italian, he possessed the Spanish language, could write and speak Latin with
    fluency, and knew something of Greek. It is clear that he had practiced poetry in the
    vernacular under the immediate influence of Tansillo. Theological studies had not
    been wholly neglected; for he left behind him at Naples editions of Jerome and
    Chrysostom with commentaries of Erasmus. These were books which exposed their
    possessors to the interdiction of the Index.</p>
    <p>It seems strange that a Dominican, escaping from his convent to avoid a trial for
    heresy, should have sought refuge at S. Maria Sopra Minerva, then the headquarters of
    the Roman Inquisition. We must, however, remember that much freedom of movement was
    allowed to monks, who found a temporary home in any monastery of their order. Without
    money, Bruno had no roof but that of a religious house to shelter him; and he
    probably reckoned on evading pursuit till the fatigues of his journey from Naples had
    been forgotten. At any rate, he made no lengthy stay in Rome. News soon reached him
    that the prosecution begun at Naples was being transferred to the metropolis. This
    implied so serious a danger that he determined to quit Rome in secret. Having flung
    his frock to the nettles, he journeyed&mdash;how, we do not know&mdash;to Genoa, and
    thence to Noli on the Riviera. The next time Bruno entered the Dominican convent
    of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>{135}</span> S. Maria
    sopra Minerva, it was as a culprit condemned to death by the Inquisition.</p>
    <p>At Noli Bruno gained a living for about five months by teaching grammar to boys
    and lecturing in private to some gentlefolk upon the Sphere. The doctrine of the
    Sphere formed a somewhat miscellaneous branch of mediaeval science. It embraced the
    exposition of Ptolemaic astronomy, together with speculations on the locality of
    heaven, the motive principle of the world, and the operation of angelical
    intelligences. Bruno, who professed this subject at various times throughout his
    wanderings, began now to use it as a vehicle for disseminating Copernican opinions.
    It is certain that cosmography formed the basis of his philosophy, and this may be
    ascribed to his early occupation with the sphere. But his restless spirit would not
    suffer him to linger in those regions where olive and orange and palm flourish almost
    more luxuriantly than in his native Nola. The gust of travel was upon him. A new
    philosophy occupied his brain, vertiginously big with incoherent births of modern
    thought. What Carlyle called 'the fire in the belly' burned and irritated his young
    blood. Unsettled, cast adrift from convent moorings, attainted for heresy, out of
    sympathy with resurgent Catholicism, he became a Vagus Quidam&mdash;a wandering
    student, like the Goliardi of the Middle Ages. From Noli he passed to Savona; from
    Savona to Turin; from Turin to Venice. There his feet might perhaps have found <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>{136}</span> rest; for Venice was
    the harbor of all vagrant spirits in that age. But the city was laid waste with
    plague. Bruno wrote a little book, now lost, on 'The Signs of the Times,' and lived
    upon the sale of it for some two months. Then he removed to Padua. Here friends
    persuaded him to reassume the cowl. There were more than 40,000 monks abroad in
    Italy, beyond the limits of their convent. Why should not he avail himself of
    house-roof in his travels, a privilege which was always open to friars? From Padua he
    journeyed rapidly again through Brescia, Bergamo and Milan to Turin, crossed Mont
    Cenis, tarried at Chamb&eacute;ry, and finally betook himself to Geneva.</p>
    <p>Geneva was no fit resting-place for Bruno. He felt an even fiercer antipathy for
    dissenting than for orthodox bigotry. The despotism of a belligerent and persecuting
    sectarian seemed to him more intolerable, because less excusable, than the Catholic
    despotism from which he was escaping. Galeazzo Caracciolo, Marquis of Vico, who then
    presided over the Italian refugees in Geneva, came to visit him. At the suggestion of
    this man Bruno once more laid aside his Dominican attire, and began to earn his bread
    by working as a reader for the press&mdash;a common resort of needy men of learning
    in those times. But he soon perceived that the Calvinistic stronghold offered no
    freedom, no security of life even, to one whose mind was bent on new developments of
    thought. After two months'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
    id="page137"></a>{137}</span> residence on the shores of Lake Leman he departed for
    Toulouse, which he entered early in 1577.</p>
    <p>We cannot help wondering why Bruno chose that city for his refuge. Toulouse, the
    only town in France where the Inquisition took firm root and flourished, Toulouse so
    perilous to Muret, so mortal to Dolet and Vanini, ought, one might have fancied, to
    have been avoided by an innovator flying from a charge of heresy.<a
    name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87"
    class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Still it must be remembered that Toulouse was French.
    Italian influence did not reach so far. Nor had Bruno committed himself even in
    thought to open rupture with Catholicism. He held the opinion, so common at that
    epoch, so inexplicable to us now, that the same man could countermine dogmatic
    theology as a philosopher, while he maintained it as a Christian. This was the
    paradox on which Pomponazzo based his apology, which kept Campanella within the pale
    of the Church, and to which Bruno appealed for his justification when afterwards
    arraigned before the Inquisitors at Venice.</p>
    <p>It appears from his own autobiographical confessions that Bruno spent some six
    months at Toulouse, lecturing in private on the peripatetic psychology; after which
    time he obtained the degree of Doctor in Philosophy, and was admitted to a Readership
    in the university. This post he occupied two years. It was a matter of some moment
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> to him that
    professors at Toulouse were not obliged to attend Mass. In his dubious position, as
    an escaped friar and disguised priest, to partake of the Sacrament would have been
    dangerous. Yet he now appears to have contemplated the possibility of reconciling
    himself to the Church, and resuming his vows in the Dominican order. He went so far
    as to open his mind upon this subject to a Jesuit; and afterwards at Paris he again
    resorted to Jesuit advice. But these conferences led to nothing. It may be presumed
    that the trial begun at Naples and removed to Rome, combined with the circumstances
    of his flight and recusant behavior, rendered the case too grave for compromise. No
    one but the Pope in Rome could decide it.</p>
    <p>There is no apparent reason why Bruno left Toulouse, except the restlessness which
    had become a marked feature in his character. We find him at Paris in 1579, where he
    at once began to lecture at the Sorbonne. It seems to have been his practice now in
    every town he visited, to combine private instruction with public disputation. His
    manners were agreeable; his conversation was eloquent and witty. He found no
    difficulty in gaining access to good society, especially in a city like Paris, which
    was then thronged with Italian exiles and courtiers. Meanwhile his public lectures
    met with less success than his private teaching. In conversation with men of birth
    and liberal culture he was able to expound views fascinating by their novelty and
    bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> ness.
    Before an academical audience it behoved him to be circumspect; nor could he
    transgress the formal methods of scholastic argumentation.</p>
    <p>Two principal subjects seem to have formed the groundwork of his teaching at this
    period. The first was the doctrine of the Thirty Divine Attributes, based on S.
    Thomas of Aquino. The second was Lully's Art of Memory and Classification of the
    Sciences. This twofold material he worked up into a single treatise, called <i>De
    Umbris Idearum</i>, which he published in 1582 at Paris, and which contains the germ
    of all his leading speculations. Bruno's metaphysics attracted less attention than
    his professed Art of Memory. In an age credulous of occult science, when men believed
    that power over nature was being won by alchemy and magic, there was no difficulty in
    persuading people that knowledge might be communicated in its essence, and that the
    faculties of the mind could be indefinitely extended, without a toilsome course of
    study. Whether Bruno lent himself wittingly to any imposture in his exposition of
    mnemonics, cannot be asserted. But it is certain that the public were led to expect
    from his method more than it could give.</p>
    <p>The fame of his Art of Memory reached the king's ears; and Henri III. sent for
    him. 'The king, says Bruno, 'had me called one day, being desirous to know whether
    the memory I possessed and professed, was natural or the result of magic art. I gave
    him satisfaction; by my explanations and by <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
    id="page140"></a>{140}</span> demonstrations to his own experience, convincing him
    that it was not an affair of magic but of science.' Henri, who might have been
    disappointed by this result, was taken with his teacher, and appointed him Reader
    Extraordinary&mdash;a post that did not oblige Bruno to hear Mass. The Ordinary
    Readers at Paris had to conform to the usages of the Catholic Church. On his side,
    Bruno appears to have conceived high admiration for the king's ability. In the
    <i>Cena della Ceneri</i> and the <i>Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante,</i> composed and
    published after he had left France, he paid him compliments in terms of hyperbolical
    laudation. It would be vain to comment on these facts. No one conversant with French
    society at that epoch could have been ignorant of Henri's character and vicious life.
    No one could have pretended that his employment of the kingdom's wealth to enrich
    unworthy favorites was anything but dishonorable, or have maintained that his
    flagrant effeminacy was beneficial to society. The fantastic superstition which the
    king indulged alternately with sensual extravagances, must have been odious to one
    whose spiritual mistress was divine Sophia, and whose religion was an adoration of
    the intellect for the One Cause. But Henri had one quality which seemed of supreme
    excellence to Bruno. He appreciated speculation and encouraged men of learning. A man
    so enthusiastic as our philosopher may have thought that his own teaching could expel
    that Beast Triumphant of the vices <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
    id="page141"></a>{141}</span> from a royal heart tainted by bad education in a
    corrupt Court. Bruno, moreover, it must be remembered, remained curiously
    inappreciative of the revolution effected in humanity by Christian morals. Much that
    is repulsive to us in the manners of the Valois, may have been indifferent to
    him.</p>
    <p>Bruno had just passed his thirtieth year. He was a man of middling height, spare
    figure, and olive complexion, wearing a short chestnut-colored beard. He spoke with
    vivacity and copious rhetoric, aiming rather at force than at purity of diction,
    indulging in trenchant metaphors to adumbrate recondite thoughts, passing from
    grotesque images to impassioned flights of declamation, blending acute arguments and
    pungent satires with grave mystical discourses. The impression of originality
    produced by his familiar conversation rendered him agreeable to princes. There was
    nothing of the pedant in his nature, nothing about him of the doctor but his
    title.</p>
    <p>After a residence of rather less than four years in Paris, he resolved upon a
    journey to England. Henri supplied him with letters of introduction to the French
    ambassador in London, Michel de Castelnau de la Mauvissi&egrave;re. This excellent
    man, who was then attempting to negotiate the marriage of Elizabeth with the Duke of
    Anjou, received Bruno into his own family as one of the gentlemen of his suite. Under
    his roof the wandering scholar enjoyed a quiet home during the two years which he
    passed in England&mdash;years that were undoubtedly the happiest, as <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>{142}</span> they were the most
    industrious, of his checkered life. It is somewhat strange that Bruno left no trace
    of his English visit in contemporary literature. Seven of his most important works
    were printed in London, though they bore the impress of Paris and Venice&mdash;for
    the very characteristic reason that English people only cared for foreign
    publications. Four of these, on purely metaphysical topics, were dedicated to Michel
    de Castelnau; two, treating of moral and psychological questions, the famous
    <i>Spaccio della Bestia</i> and <i>Gli eroici Furori</i>, were inscribed to Sidney.
    The <i>Cena delle Ceneri</i> describes a supper party at the house of Fulke Greville;
    and it is clear from numerous allusions scattered up and down these writings, that
    their author was admitted on terms of familiarity to the best English society. Yet no
    one mentions him. Fulke Greville in his Life of Sidney passes him by in silence; nor
    am I aware that any one of Sidney's panegyrists, the name of whom is legion, alludes
    to the homage paid him by the Italian philosopher.</p>
    <p>On his side, Bruno has bequeathed to us animated pictures of his life in London,
    portraying the English of that period as they impressed a sensitive Italian.<a
    name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88"
    class="fnanchor">[88]</a> His descriptions are valuable, since they dwell on slight
    particulars unnoticed by ambassadors in their dispatches. He was much struck with the
    filth and unkempt desolation of the streets adjacent to the Thames, the rudeness of
    the watermen who <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
    id="page143"></a>{143}</span> plied their craft upon the river, and the stalwart
    beef-eating brutality of prentices and porters. The population of London displayed
    its antipathy to foreigners by loud remarks, hustled them in narrow lanes, and played
    at rough-and-tumble with them after the manners of a bear-garden. But there is no
    hint that these big fellows shouldering through the crowd were treacherous or ready
    with their knives. The servants of great houses seemed to Bruno discourteous and
    savage; yet he says nothing about such subtlety and vice as rendered the retainers of
    Italian nobles perilous to order. He paints the broad portrait of a muscular and
    insolently insular people, untainted by the evils of corrupt civilization. Mounting
    higher in the social scale, Bruno renders deserved homage to the graceful and
    unaffected manners of young English noblemen, from whom he singles Sidney out as the
    star of cultivated chivalry.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>
    <p>What he says about the well-born youth of England, shows that the flower of our
    gentlefolk delighted Southern observers by their mixture of simplicity and sweetness
    with good breeding and sound sense. For the ladies of England he cannot find words
    fair enough to extol the beauties of their persons and the purity of their
    affections. Elizabeth herself he calls a goddess, <i>diva</i>, using phrases which
    were after<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>{144}</span> wards
    recited in the terms of his indictment before the Inquisition. What pleased him most
    in England, was the liberty of speech and thought he there enjoyed.<a
    name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90"
    class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Society was so urbane, government was so unsuspicious, that
    a man could venture to call things by their proper names and speak his heart out
    without reserve. That Bruno's panegyric was not prompted by any wish to flatter
    national vanity, is proved by the hard truths he spoke about the grossness of the
    people, and by his sarcasms on Oxford pedants. He also ventured to condemn in no
    unmeasured terms some customs which surprised him in domestic intercourse. He drew,
    for instance, a really gruesome picture of the loving-cup, as it passed round the
    table, tasted by a mixed assemblage.<a name="FNanchor_91_91"
    id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>
    <p>A visit paid by Bruno to Oxford forms a curious episode in his English
    experiences. He found that university possessed by pedants and ignorant professors of
    the old learning. 'Men of choice,' he calls them, 'trailing their long velvet gowns,
    this one arrayed with two bright chains of gold around his neck, that one, good
    heavens! with such a valuable hand&mdash;twelve rings upon two fingers, giving him
    the look of some rich jeweler.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> These excellent dons, blest in the
    possession of fat fellowships, felt no sympathy for an eccentric interloper of
    Bruno's stamp. They allowed him to lecture on the Soul and the Sphere.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>{145}</span> They even
    condescended to dispute with him. Yet they made Oxford so unpleasant a place of
    residence that after three months he returned to London. The treatment he experienced
    rankled in his memory. 'Look where you like at the present moment, you will find but
    doctors in grammar here; for in this happy realm there reigns a constellation of
    pedantic stubborn ignorance and presumption mixed with a rustic incivility that would
    disturb Job's patience. If you do not believe it, go to Oxford, and ask to hear what
    happened to the Nolan, when he disputed publicly with those doctors of theology in
    the presence of the Polish Prince Alasco.<a name="FNanchor_93_93"
    id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Make them
    tell you how they answered to his syllogisms; how the pitiful professor, whom they
    put before them on that grave occasion as the Corypheus of their university, bungled
    fifteen times with fifteen syllogisms, like a chicken in the stubble. Make them tell
    you with what rudeness and discourtesy that pig behaved; what patience and humanity
    he met from his opponent, who, in truth, proclaimed himself a Neapolitan, born and
    brought up beneath more genial heavens. Then learn after what fashion they brought
    his public lectures to an end, those on the Immortality of the Soul and those on the
    Quintuple Sphere.'<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> The Soul and the Sphere were Bruno's
    favorite themes. He handled both at this period of life with startling audacity.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> They had
    become for him the means of ventilating speculations on terrestrial movement, on the
    multiplicity of habitable worlds, on the principle of the universe, and on the
    infinite modes of psychical metamorphosis. Such topics were not calculated to endear
    him to people of importance on the banks of Isis. That he did not humor their
    prejudices, appears from a Latin epistle which he sent before him by way of
    introduction to the Vice Chancellor.<a name="FNanchor_95_95"
    id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> It
    contains these pompous phrases: 'Philotheus Jordanus Brunus Nolanus magis laboratae
    theologiae doctor, purioris et innocuae sapientiae professor. In praecipuis Europae
    academiis notus, probatus et honorifice exceptus philosophus. Nullibi praeterquam
    apud barbaros et ignobiles peregrinus. Dormitantium animarum excubitor. Praesuntuosae
    et recalcitrantis ignorantiae domitor. Qui in actibus universis generalem
    philantropiam protestatur. Qui non magis Italum quam Britannum, marem quam foeminam,
    mitratum quam coronatum, togatum quam armatum, cucullatum hominem quam sine cucullo
    virum: sed ilium cujus pacatior, civilior, fidelior et utilior est conversatio
    diligit.' Which may thus be Englished: 'Giordano Bruno of Nola, the God-loving, of
    the more highly-wrought theology doctor, of the purer and harmless wisdom professor.
    In the chief universities of Europe known, approved, and honorably received as
    philosopher. Nowhere save among barbarians and the ignoble a stranger. <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>{147}</span> The awakener of
    sleeping souls. The trampler upon presuming and recalcitrant ignorance. Who in all
    his acts proclaims a universal benevolence toward man. Who loveth not Italian more
    than Briton, male than female, mitred than crowned head, gowned than armed, frocked
    than frockless; but seeketh after him whose conversation is the more peaceful, more
    civil, more loyal, and more profitable.' This manifesto, in the style of a
    mountebank, must have sounded like a trumpet-blast to set the humdrum English doctors
    with sleepy brains and moldy science on their guard against a man whom they naturally
    regarded as an Italian charlatan. What, indeed, was this more highly-wrought
    theology, this purer wisdom? What call had this self-panegyrist to stir souls from
    comfortable slumbers? What right had he to style the knowledge of his brethren
    ignorance? Probably he was but some pestilent fellow, preaching unsound doctrine on
    the Trinity, like Peter Martyr Vermigli, who had been properly hissed out of Oxford a
    quarter of a century earlier. When Bruno arrived and lectured, their worst
    prognostications were fulfilled. Did he not maintain a theory of the universe which
    even that perilous speculator and political schemer, Francis Bacon, sneered at as
    nugatory?</p>
    <p>In spite of academical opposition, Bruno enjoyed fair weather, halcyon months, in
    England. His description of the Ash Wednesday Supper at Fulke Greville's, shows that
    a niche had been carved out <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"
    id="page148"></a>{148}</span> for him in London, where he occupied a pedestal of some
    importance. Those gentlemen of Elizabeth's Court did not certainly exaggerate the
    value of their Italian guest. In Italy, most of them had met with spirits of Bruno's
    stamp, whom they had not time or opportunity to prove. He was one among a hundred
    interesting foreigners; and his martyrdom had not as yet set the crown of glory or of
    shame upon his forehead. They probably accepted him as London society of the present
    day accepts a theosophist from Simla or Thibet. But his real home at this epoch, the
    only home, so far as I can see, that Bruno ever had, after he left his mother at the
    age of thirteen for a convent, was the house of Castelnau. The truest chords in the
    Italian's voice vibrate when he speaks of that sound Frenchman. To Mme. de Castelnau
    he alludes with respectful sincerity, paying her the moderate and well-weighed homage
    which, for a noble woman, is the finest praise. There is no rhetoric in the words he
    uses to express his sense of obligation to her kindness. They are delicate, inspired
    with a tact which makes us trust the writer's sense of fitness.<a
    name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96"
    class="fnanchor">[96]</a> But Bruno indulges in softer phrases, drawn from the heart,
    and eminently characteristic of his predominant enthusiastic mood, when he comes to
    talk of the little girl, Marie, who brightened the home of the Castelnaus. 'What
    shall I say of their noble-natured daughter? She has gazed upon the sun barely one
    luster and one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>{149}</span>
    year; but so far as language goes, I know not how to judge whether she springs from
    Italy or France or England! From her hand, touching the instruments of music, no man
    could reckon if she be of corporate or incorporeal substance. Her perfected goodness
    makes one marvel whether she be flown from heaven, or be a creature of this common
    earth. It is at least evident to every man that for the shaping of so fair a body the
    blood of both her parents has contributed, while for the tissue of her rare spirit
    the virtues of their heroic souls have been combined.'<a name="FNanchor_97_97"
    id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>
    <p>It was time to leave these excellent and hospitable friends. 'Forth from the
    tranquil to the trembling air' Bruno's unquiet impulse drove him. He returned to
    Paris at the end of 1585, disputed before the Sorbonne with some success of scandal,
    and then, disquieted by the disorders of the realm, set out for Germany. We find him
    at Marburg in the following year, ill-received by the University, but welcomed by the
    Prince. Thence we follow him to Mainz, and afterwards to Wittenberg, where he spent
    two years. Here he conceived a high opinion of the Germans. He foresaw that when they
    turned their attention from theology to science and pure speculation, great results
    might be expected from their solid intellectual capacity. He seems in fact to have
    taken a pretty accurate measure of the race as it has subsequently shown itself.
    Wittenberg he called the German Athens. Luther, he recog<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page150" id="page150"></a>{150}</span> nized as a hero of humanity, who, like
    himself, defied authority in the defense of truth. Yet he felt no sympathy for the
    German reformers. When asked by the Inquisitors at Venice what he thought about these
    men, he replied: 'I regard them as more ignorant than I am. I despise them and their
    doctrines. They do not deserve the name of theologians, but of pedants.' That this
    reply was sincere, is abundantly proved by passages in the least orthodox of Bruno's
    writings. It was the weakness of a philosopher's position at that moment that he
    derived no support from either of the camps into which Christendom was then divided.
    Catholics and Protestants of every shade regarded him with mistrust.</p>
    <p>A change in the religious policy of Saxony, introduced after the death of the
    Elector Augustus, caused Bruno to leave Wittenberg for Prague in 1588. From Prague he
    passed to Helmst&auml;dt, where the Duke Heinrich Julius of
    Brunswick-Wolfenb&uuml;ttel received him with distinction, and bestowed on him a
    purse of eighty dollars.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Here he conceived two of his most
    important works, the <i>De Monade</i> and <i>De Triplici Minimo</i>, both written in
    Latin hexameters.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Why he adopted this new form of
    exposition is not manifest. Possibly he was tired of dialogues, through which he had
    expressed his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span>
    thought so freely in England. Possibly a German public would have been indifferent to
    Italian. Possibly he was emulous of his old masters, Parmenides and Lucretius.</p>
    <p>At Helmst&auml;dt he came into collision with Boetius, the rector of the
    Evangelical church, who issued a sentence of excommunication against him. Like a new
    Odysseus, he set forth once again upon his voyage, and in the spring of 1590 anchored
    in Frankfort on the Main. A convent (that of the Carmelites) sheltered him in this
    city, where he lived on terms of intimacy with the printers Wechel and Fischer, and
    other men of learning. It would appear from evidence laid before the Venetian
    Inquisitors that the prior of the monastery judged him to be a man of genius and
    doctrine, devoid of definite religion, addicted to fantastic studies, and bent on the
    elaboration of a philosophy that should supersede existing creeds.<a
    name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100"
    class="fnanchor">[100]</a> This was a not inaccurate portrait of Bruno as he then
    appeared to conservatives of commonplace capacity. Yet nothing occurred to irritate
    him in the shape of persecution or disturbance. Bruno worked in quiet at Frankfort,
    pouring forth thousands of metaphysical verses, some at least of which were committed
    to the press in three volumes published by the Wechels.</p>
    <p>Between Frankfort and Italy literary communications were kept open through the
    medium of the great fair, which took place every year at Michael<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> mas.<a
    name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101"
    class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Books formed one of the principal commodities, and the
    Italian bibliopoles traveled across the Alps to transact business on these important
    occasions. It happened by such means that a work of Bruno's, perhaps the <i>De
    Monude</i>, found its way to Venice.<a name="FNanchor_102_102"
    id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
    Exposed on the counter of Giambattista Ciotto, then plying the trade of bookseller in
    that city, this treatise met the eyes of a Venetian gentleman called Giovanni
    Mocenigo. He belonged to one of the most illustrious of the still surviving noble
    families in Venice. The long line of their palaces upon the Grand Canal has impressed
    the mind of every tourist. One of these houses, it may be remarked, was occupied by
    Lord Byron, who, had he known of Bruno's connection with the Mocenighi, would
    undoubtedly have given to the world a poem or a drama on the fate of our philosopher.
    Giovanni Mocenigo was a man verging on middle life, superstitious, acknowledging the
    dominion of his priest, but alive in a furtive way to perilous ideas. Morally, he
    stands before us as a twofold traitor: a traitor to his Church, so long as he hoped
    to gain illicit power by magic arts; a traitor to his guest, so soon as he discovered
    that his soul's risk brought himself no profit.<a name="FNanchor_103_103"
    id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> He
    seems to have imagined <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"
    id="page153"></a>{153}</span> that Bruno might teach him occult science or direct him
    on a royal way to knowledge without strenuous study. Subsequent events proved that,
    though he had no solid culture, he was fascinated by the expectation of discovering
    some great secret. It was the vice of the age to confound science with sorcery, and
    Bruno had lent himself to this delusion by his whimsical style. Perhaps the
    booksellers, who then played a part scarcely less prominent than that of the barbers
    in diffusing gossip, inflamed Mocenigo's curiosity by painting the author of the
    puzzling volume in seductive colors. Any how this man sent two letters, one through
    Ciotto, and one direct to Bruno, praying him to visit Venice, professing his desire
    for instruction, and offering him an honorable place of residence.</p>
    <p>In an evil hour Bruno accepted this invitation. No doubt he longed to see Italy
    again after so many years of exile. Certainly he had the right to believe that he
    would find hospitality and a safe refuge in Venice. Had not a Venetian noble pledged
    his word for the former? Was not the latter a privilege which S. Mark extended to all
    suppliants? The Republic professed to shield even the outlaws of the Inquisition, if
    they claimed her jurisdiction. There was therefore no palpable imprudence in the step
    which Bruno now took. Yet he took it under circumstances which would have made a
    cautious man <span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>{154}</span>
    mistrustful. Of Mocenigo he knew merely nothing. But he did know that writs from the
    Holy Office had been out against himself in Italy for many years, during which he had
    spent his time in conversing with heretics and printing works of more than
    questionable orthodoxy.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Nothing proves the force of the
    vagrant's impulse which possessed Bruno, more than his light and ready consent to
    Giovanni Mocenigo's proposal.</p>
    <p>He set off at once from Frankfort, leaving the MS. of one of his metaphysical
    poems in Wechel's hands to print, and found himself at the end of 1591 a guest of his
    unknown patron. I have already described what Mocenigo hoped to gain from
    Bruno&mdash;the arts of memory and invention, together with glimpses into occult
    science.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> We know how little Bruno was able
    to satisfy an in satiable curiosity in such matters. One of his main weaknesses was a
    habit of boasting and exaggerating his own powers, which at first imposed upon a
    vulgar audience and then left them under the impression that he was a charlatan. The
    bookseller Ciotto learned from students who had conversed with him at Frankfort, that
    'he professed an art of memory and other secrets in the sciences, but that all the
    persons who had dealt with him in such matters, had left him discontinued.'<a
    name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106"
    class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>{155}</span> Another
    weakness in his character was extraordinary want of caution. Having lived about the
    world so long, and changed from town to town, supporting himself as he best could, he
    had acquired the custom of attracting notice by startling paradoxes. Nor does he seem
    to have cared to whom he made the dangerous confidence of his esoteric beliefs. His
    public writings, presumably composed with a certain circumspection&mdash;since
    everybody knows the proverb <i>litera scripta manet</i>&mdash;contain such perilous
    stuff that&mdash;when we consider what their author may have let fall in unguarded
    conversation&mdash;we are prepared to credit the charges brought against him by
    Mocenigo. For it must now be said that this man, 'induced by the obligation of his
    conscience and by order of his confessor,' denounced Bruno to the Inquisition on May
    23, 1592.</p>
    <p>When the two men, so entirely opposite in their natures, first came together,
    Bruno began to instruct his patron in the famous art of memory and mathematics. At
    the same time he discoursed freely and copiously, according to his wont, upon his own
    philosophy. Mocenigo took no interest in metaphysics, and was terrified by the
    audacity of Bruno's speculations. It enraged him to find how meager was Bruno's
    vaunted method for acquiring and retaining knowledge without pains. In his secret
    heart he believed that the teacher whom he had maintained at a considerable cost, was
    withholding the occult knowledge he so much coveted. Bruno, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page156" id="page156"></a>{156}</span> meanwhile, attended Andrea Morosini's
    receptions in the palace at S. Luca, and frequented those of Bernardo Secchini at the
    sign of the Golden Ship in the Merceria. He made friends with scholars and men of
    fashion; absented himself for weeks together at Padua; showed that he was tired of
    Mocenigo; and ended by rousing that man's suspicious jealousy. Mocenigo felt that he
    had been deceived by an impostor, who, instead of furnishing the wares for which he
    bargained, put him off with declamations on the nature of the universe. What was even
    more terrible, he became convinced that this charlatan was an obstinate heretic.</p>
    <p>Whether Bruno perceived the gathering of the storm above his head, whether he was
    only wearied with the importunities of his host, or whether, as he told the
    Inquisitors, he wished to superintend the publication of some books at Frankfort,
    does not greatly signify. At any rate, he begged Mocenigo to excuse him from further
    attendance, since he meant to leave Venice. This happened on Thursday, May 21. Next
    day, Mocenigo sent his bodyservant together with five or six gondoliers into Bruno's
    apartment, seized him, and had him locked up in a ground-floor room of the palace. At
    the same time he laid hands on all Bruno's effects, including the MS. of one
    important treatise <i>On the Seven Liberal Arts</i>, which was about to be dedicated
    to Pope Clement VIII. This, together with other unpublished works, exists probably in
    the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> Vatican
    Archives, having been sent with the papers referring to Bruno's trial from Venice
    when he was transported to Rome. The following day, which was a Saturday, Mocenigo
    caused Bruno to be carried to one of those cellars (<i>magazzeni terreni</i>) which
    are used in Venice for storing wood, merchandise or implements belonging to gondolas.
    In the evening, a Captain of the Council of Ten removed him to the dungeons of the
    Inquisition. On the same day, May 23, Mocenigo lodged his denunciation with the Holy
    Office.</p>
    <p>The heads of this accusation, extracted from the first report and from two
    subsequent additions made by the delator, amount to these. Though Bruno was adverse
    to religions altogether, he preferred the Catholic to any other; but he believed it
    to stand in need of thorough reform. The doctrines of the Trinity, the miraculous
    birth of Christ, and transubstantiation, were insults to the Divine Being. Christ had
    seduced the people by working apparent miracles. So also had the Apostles. To develop
    a new philosophy which should supersede religions, and to prove his superiority in
    knowledge over S. Thomas and all the theologians, was Bruno's cherished scheme. He
    did not believe in the punishment of sins; but held a doctrine of the transmigration
    of souls, and of the generation of the human soul from refuse. The world he thought
    to be eternal. He maintained that there were infinite worlds, all made by God, who
    wills to do what he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"
    id="page158"></a>{158}</span> can do, and therefore produces infinity. The religious
    orders of Catholicism defile the earth by evil life, hypocrisy, and avarice. All
    friars are only asses. Indulgence in carnal pleasures ought not to be reckoned
    sinful. The man confessed to having freely satisfied his passions to the utmost of
    his opportunities.</p>
    <p>On being questioned before the Inquisitors, Mocenigo supported these charges. He
    added that when he had threatened Bruno with delation, Bruno replied, first, that he
    did not believe he would betray his confidence by making private conversation the
    groundwork of criminal charges; secondly, that the utmost the Inquisition could do,
    would be to inflict some penance and force him to resume the cowl. These, which are
    important assertions, bearing the mark of truth, throw light on his want of caution
    in dealing with Mocenigo, and explain the attitude he afterwards assumed before the
    Holy Office.</p>
    <p>Mocenigo's accusations in the main yield evidences of sincerity. They are exactly
    what we should expect from the distortion of Bruno's doctrines by a mind incapable of
    comprehending them. In short, they are as veracious as the image of a face reflected
    on a spoon. Certain gross details (the charges, for example, of having called Christ
    a <i>tristo</i> who was deservedly hung, and of having sneered at the virginity of
    Mary) may possibly have emanated from the delator's own imagination.<a
    name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107"
    class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>{159}</span> Bruno
    emphatically repudiated these; though some passages in his philosophical poems,
    published at Frankfort, contain the substance of their blasphemies. A man of
    Mocenigo's stamp probably thought that he was faithfully representing the heretic's
    views, while in reality he was drawing his own gross conclusions from skeptical
    utterances about the origin of Christianity which he obscurely understood. It does
    not seem incredible, however, that Bruno, who was never nice in his choice of
    language, and who certainly despised historical Christianity, let fall crude
    witticisms upon such and other points in Mocenigo's presence.</p>
    <p>Bruno appeared before the Venetian Inquisition on May 29. His examination was
    continued at intervals from this date till July 30. His depositions consist for the
    most part of an autobiographical statement which he volunteered, and of a frank
    elucidation of his philosophical doctrines in their relation to orthodox belief.
    While reading the lengthy pages of his trial, we seem to overhear a man conversing
    confidentially with judges from whom he expected liberal sympathy. Over and over
    again, he relies for his defense upon the old distinction between philosophy and
    faith, claiming to have advocated views as a thinker which he does not hold as a
    Christian. 'In all my books I have used philosophical methods of definition according
    to the principles and light of nature, not taking chief regard of that which ought to
    be held in faith; <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
    id="page160"></a>{160}</span> and I believe they do not contain anything which can
    support the accusation that I have professedly impugned religion rather than that I
    have sought to exalt philosophy; though I may have expounded many impieties based
    upon my natural light.'<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> In another place he uses the
    antithesis, 'speaking like a Christian and according to theology'&mdash;'speaking
    after the manner of philosophy.'<a name="FNanchor_109_109"
    id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The
    same antithesis is employed to justify his doctrine of metempsychosis: 'Speaking as a
    Catholic, souls do not pass from one body into another, but go to paradise or
    purgatory or hell; yet, following philosophical reasonings, I have argued that, the
    soul being inexistent without the body and inexistent in the body, it can be
    indifferently in one or in another body, and can pass from one into another, which,
    if it be not true, seems at any rate probable according to the opinion of
    Pythagoras.'<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>
    <p>That he expected no severe punishment appears from the terms of his so-called
    recantation. 'I said that I wished to present myself before the feet of his Holiness
    with certain books which I approve, though I have published others which I do not now
    approve; whereby I meant to say that some works composed and published by me do not
    meet with my approbation, inasmuch as in these I have spoken and discussed too
    philosophically, in unseemly wise, not altogether as a good Christian ought; in
    particular I know that in some of these works I have taught and philosophically held
    things which ought <span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"
    id="page161"></a>{161}</span> to be attributed to the power, wisdom and goodness of
    God according to the Christian faith, founding doctrine in such matters on sense and
    reason, not upon faith.'<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> At the very end of his
    examination, he placed himself in the hands of his judges, 'confessing his errors
    with a willing mind,' acknowledging that he had 'erred and strayed from the Church,'
    begging for such castigation as shall not 'bring public dishonor on the sacred robe
    which he had worn,' and promising to 'show a noteworthy reform, and to recompense the
    scandal he had caused by edification at least equal in magnitude.'<a
    name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112"
    class="fnanchor">[112]</a> These professions he made upon his knees, evincing
    clearly, as it seems to me, that at this epoch he was ready to rejoin the Dominican
    order, and that, as he affirmed to Mocenigo, he expected no worse punishment than
    this.</p>
    <p>In attempting to estimate Bruno's recantation, we must remember that he felt no
    sympathy at all for heretics. When questioned about them, he was able to quote
    passages from his own works in which he called the Reformation a Deformation of
    religion.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Lutheran and Calvinist
    theologians were alike pedants in his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_114_114"
    id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>
    There is no doubt that Bruno meant what he said; and had he been compelled to choose
    one of the existing religions, he would have preferred Catholicism. He was, in fact,
    at a period of life when he wished to dedicate his time in quiet to metaphysical
    studies. He had matured his philo<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"
    id="page162"></a>{162}</span> sophy and brought it to a point at which he thought it
    could be presented as a peace-offering to the Supreme Pontiff. Conformity to
    ecclesiastical observances seemed no longer irksome to the world-experienced,
    wide-reaching mind of the man. Nor does he appear to have anticipated that his formal
    submission would not be readily accepted. He reckoned strangely, in this matter,
    without the murderous host into whose clutches he had fallen.</p>
    <p>Searching interrogations touching other heads in the evidence against him, as
    blasphemous remarks on sacred persons, intercourse with heretics, abuse of the
    religious orders, dealings in magic arts, licentious principles of conduct, were
    answered by Bruno with a frank assurance, which proves his good conscience in
    essentials and his firm expectation of a favorable issue to the affair. Mocenigo had
    described him as <i>indemoniato</i>; and considering the manifest peril in which he
    now stood, there is something scarcely sane in the confidence he showed. For Mocenigo
    himself he reserved words of bitterest scorn and indignation. When questioned in the
    usual terms whether he had enemies at Venice, he replied: 'I know of none but Ser
    Giovanni Mocenigo and his train of servants. By him I have been grievously injured,
    more so than by living man, seeing he has murdered me in my life, my honor and my
    property, having imprisoned me in his own house and stolen all my writings, books,
    and other effects. And this he did because he <span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"
    id="page163"></a>{163}</span> not only wished that I should teach him everything I
    know, but also wished to prevent my teaching it to any one but him. He has continued
    to threaten me upon the points of life and honor, unless I should teach him
    everything I knew.'<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>
    <p>The scene closes over Bruno in the Venetian Inquisition on July 30, 1592. We do
    not behold him again till he enters the Minerva at Rome to receive his death-sentence
    on February 9, 1600. What happened in the interval is almost a blank. An exchange of
    letters took place between Rome and Venice concerning his extradition, and the
    Republic made some show of reluctance to part with a refugee within its jurisdiction.
    But this diplomatic affair was settled to the satisfaction of both parties, and Bruno
    disappeared into the dungeons of the Roman Inquisition in the month of January
    1593.</p>
    <p>Seven years of imprisonment was a long period.<a name="FNanchor_116_116"
    id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>
    <p>We find it hard to understand why Bruno's prosecution occupied the Holy Office
    through this space of time. But conjectures on the subject are now useless. Equally
    futile is it to speculate whether Bruno offered to conform in life and doctrine to
    the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>{164}</span> Church at
    Rome as he had done at Venice. The temptation to do so must have been great. Most
    probably he begged for grace, but grace was not accorded on his own terms; and he
    chose death rather than dishonor and a lie in the last resort, or rather than
    life-long incarceration. It is also singular that but few contemporaries mention the
    fact of his condemnation and execution. Rome was crowded in the jubilee year of 1600.
    Bruno was burned in open daylight on the Campo di Fiora. Yet the only eye-witness who
    records the event, is Gaspar Schoppe, or Scioppius, who wrote a letter on the subject
    to his friend Rittershausen. Kepler, eight years afterwards, informed his
    correspondent Breugger that Bruno had been really burned: 'he bore his agonizing
    death with fortitude, abiding by the asseveration that all religions are vain, and
    that God identifies himself with the world, circumference and center.' Kepler, it may
    be observed, conceived a high opinion of Bruno's speculations, and pointed him out to
    Galileo as the man who had divined the infinity of solar systems in their correlation
    to one infinite order of the universe.<a name="FNanchor_117_117"
    id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span> Scioppius
    was a German humanist of the elder Italianated type, an elegant Latin stylist, who
    commented indifferently on the <i>Priapeia</i> and the Stoic philosophy. He abjured
    Protestantism, and like Muretus, sold his pen to Rome. The Jesuits, in his pompous
    panegyric, were first saluted as 'the praetorian cohort of the camp of God.'
    Afterwards, when he quarreled with their Order, he showered invectives on them in the
    manner of a Poggio or Filelfo. The literary infamies of the fifteenth century
    reappeared in his polemical attacks on Protestants, and in his satires upon Scaliger.
    Yet he was a man of versatile talents and considerable erudition. It must be
    mentioned in his honor that he visited Campanella in his prison, and exerted himself
    for his liberation. Campanella dedicated his <i>Atheismus Triumphatus</i> to
    Scioppius, calling him 'the dawn-star of our age.' Schoppe was also the first
    credible authority to warn Sarpi of the imminent peril he ran from Roman hired
    assassins, as I hope to relate in my chapter upon Sarpi's life. This man's letter to
    his friend is the single trustworthy document which we possess regarding the last
    hours of Bruno. Its inaccuracies on minor points may be held to corroborate his
    testimony.</p>
    <p>Scioppius refers to Bruno's early heresies on Transubstantiation and the Virginity
    of Mary. He alludes to the <i>Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante</i>, as though it had
    been a libel on the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>{166}</span> He then
    enumerates Bruno's heterodox opinions, which had been recited in the public
    condemnation pronounced on the heresiarch. 'Horrible and most utterly absurd are the
    views he entertained, as, for example, that there are innumerable worlds; that the
    soul migrates from body to body, yea into another world, and that one soul can inform
    two bodies; that magic is good and lawful; that the Holy Spirit is nothing but the
    Soul of the World, which Moses meant when he wrote that it brooded on the waters;
    that the world has existed from eternity; that Moses wrought his miracles by magic,
    being more versed therein than the Egyptians, and that he composed his own laws; that
    the Holy Scriptures are a dream, and that the devils will be saved; that only the
    Jews descend from Adam and Eve, the rest of men from that pair whom God created
    earlier; that Christ is not God, but that he was an eminent magician who deluded
    mankind, and was therefore rightly hanged, not crucified; that the prophets and
    Apostles were men of naught, magicians, and for the most part hanged: in short,
    without detailing all the monstrosities in which his books abound, and which he
    maintained in conversation, it may be summed up in one word that he defended every
    error that has been advanced by pagan philosophers or by heretics of earlier and
    present times.' Accepting this list as tolerably faithful to the terms of Bruno's
    sentence, heard by Scioppius in the hall of Minerva, we can see how Mocenigo's
    accusation had been verified by reference to his published <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page167" id="page167"></a>{167}</span> works. The <i>De Monade</i> and <i>De
    Triplici</i> contain enough heterodoxy to substantiate each point.</p>
    <p>On February 9, Bruno was brought before the Holy Office at S. Maria sopra Minerva.
    In the presence of assembled Cardinals, theologians, and civil magistrates, his
    heresies were first recited. Then he was excommunicated, and degraded from his
    priestly and monastic offices. Lastly, he was handed over to the secular arm, 'to be
    punished with all clemency and without effusion of blood.' This meant in plain
    language to be burned alive. Thereupon Bruno uttered the memorable and monumental
    words: 'Peradventure ye pronounce this sentence on me with a greater fear than I
    receive it.' They were the last words he spoke in public. He was removed to the
    prisons of the State, where he remained eight days, in order that he might have time
    to repent. But he continued obdurate. Being an apostate priest and a relapsed
    heretic, he could hope for no remission of his sentence. Therefore, on February 17,
    he marched to a certain and horrible death. The stake was built up on the Campo di
    Fiora. Just before the wood was set on fire, they offered him the crucifix.<a
    name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119"
    class="fnanchor">[119]</a> He turned his face away from it in stern disdain. It was
    not Christ but his own soul, wherein he believed the Diety resided, that sustained
    Bruno at the supreme moment.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>{168}</span> No cry, no
    groan, escaped his lips. Thus, as Scioppius affectedly remarked, 'he perished
    miserably in flames, and went to report in those other worlds of his imagination, how
    blasphemous and impious men are handled by the Romans.'</p>
    <p>Whatever we may think of the good taste of Bruno's sarcasms upon the faith in
    which he had been bred&mdash;and it is certain that he never rightly apprehended
    Christianity in its essence&mdash;there is no doubt he died a valiant martyr to the
    truth as he conceived it. 'His death like that of Paleario, Carnesecchi, and so many
    more, no less than countless exiles suffered for religious causes, are a proof that
    in Italy men had begun to recognize their obligation to a faith, the duty of
    obedience to a thought: an immense progress, not sufficiently appreciated even by
    modern historians.'<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Bruno was a hero in the battle
    for the freedom of the conscience, for the right of man to think and speak in
    liberty.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>
    <p>Just five years before this memorable 17th of February, Tasso had passed quietly
    away in S. Onofrio. 'How dissimilar in genius and fortune,' exclaims Berti, 'were
    these men, though born under <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169"
    id="page169"></a>{169}</span> the same skies, though in childhood they breathed the
    same air! Tasso a Christian and poet of the cross; Bruno hostile to all religious
    symbols. The one, tired and disillusioned of the world, ends his days in the repose
    of the convent; the other sets out from the convent to expire upon the scaffold,
    turning his eyes away from the crucifix.'<a name="FNanchor_122_122"
    id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> And
    yet how much alike in some important circumstances of their lives were these two men!
    Both wanderers, possessed by that spirit of vagrancy which is the outward expression
    of an inner restlessness. The unfrocked friar, the courtier out of service, had no
    home in Italy. Both were pursued by an oestrum corresponding to the intellectual
    perturbations which closed the sixteenth century, so different from the idyllic calm
    that rested upon Ariosto and the artists of its opening years. Sufficient justice has
    not yet been done in history to the Italian wanderers and exiles of this period, men
    who carried the spirit of the Renaissance abroad, after the Renaissance had ended in
    Italy, to the extremest verges of the civilized world. An enumeration of their names,
    an examination of their services to modern thought, would show how puissant was the
    intellectual influence of Italy in that period of her political decadence.<a
    name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123"
    class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
    <p>Bruno has to be treated from two distinct but <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page170" id="page170"></a>{170}</span> interdependent points of view&mdash;in
    his relation to contemporary thought and the Renaissance; and in his relation to the
    evolution of modern philosophy&mdash;as the critic of mediaeval speculation and the
    champion of sixteenth-century enthusiasm; and also as the precursor of Descartes,
    Spinoza, Leibnitz, Schelling, Hegel, Darwin.</p>
    <p>From the former of these two points of view Bruno appears before us as the man who
    most vitally and comprehensively grasped the leading tendencies of his age in their
    intellectual essence. He left behind him the mediaeval conception of an extra-mundane
    God, creating a finite world, of which this globe is the center, and the principal
    episode in the history of which is the series of events from the Fall, through the
    Incarnation and Crucifixion, to the Last Judgment.<a name="FNanchor_124_124"
    id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> He
    substituted the conception of an ever-living, ever-acting, ever-self-effectuating
    God, immanent in an infinite universe, to the contemplation of whose attributes the
    mind of man ascends by study of Nature and interrogation of his conscience. The
    rehabilitation of the physical world and of humanity as part of its order, which the
    Renaissance had already indirectly effected through the medium of arts and literature
    and modes of life, found in Bruno an impassioned metaphysical supporter. He divinized
    Nature, not by degrading the Deity to matter, but by lifting matter <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>{171}</span> to participation in
    the divine existence. The Renaissance had proclaimed the dignity of man considered as
    a mundane creature, and not in his relation to a hypothetical other-world. It
    abundantly manifested the beauty and the joy afforded by existence on this planet,
    and laughingly discarded past theological determinations to the contrary of its new
    Gospel. Bruno undertook the systematization of Renaissance intuitions; declared the
    divine reality of Nature and of man; demonstrated that we cannot speculate God,
    cannot think ourselves, cannot envisage the universe, except under the form of one
    living, infinite, eternal, divinely-sustained and soul-penetrated complex. He
    repudiated authority of every sort, refusing to acknowledge the decrees of the
    Church, freely criticising past philosophers, availing himself of all that seemed to
    him substantial in their speculations, but appealing in the last resort to that inner
    witness, that light of reason, which corresponds in the mental order to conscience in
    the moral. As he deified Nature, so he emancipated man as forming with Nature an
    integral part of the supreme Being. He was led upon this path to combat Aristotle and
    to satirize Christian beliefs, with a subtlety of scholastic argumentation and an
    acerbity of rhetoric that now pass for antiquated. Much that is obsolete in his
    writings must be referred to the polemical necessities of an age enthralled by
    peripatetic conceptions, and saturated with the ecclesiastical divinity of the
    schoolmen.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>{172}</span> These forces
    of the philosophy he sought to supersede, had to be attacked with their own weapons
    and by methods adapted to the spirit of his age. Similar judgment may be passed upon
    his championship of the Copernican system. That system was the pivot of his
    metaphysic, the revelation to which he owed his own conception of the universe. His
    strenuous and ingenious endeavors to prove its veracity, his elaborate and
    often-repeated refutations of the Ptolemaic theory, appear to modern minds
    superfluous. But we must remember what a deeply-penetrating, widely-working
    revolution Copernicus effected in cosmology, how he dislocated the whole fabric upon
    which Catholic theology rested, how new and unintelligible his doctrine then seemed,
    and what vast horizons he opened for speculation on the destinies of man. Bruno was
    the first fully to grasp the importance of the Copernican hypothesis, to perceive its
    issues and to adapt it to the formation of a new ontology. Copernicus, though he
    proclaimed the central position of the sun in our system, had not ventured to
    maintain the infinity of the universe. For him, as for the elder physicists, there
    remained a sphere of fixed stars inclosing the world perceived by our senses within
    walls of crystal. Bruno broke those walls, and boldly asserted the now recognized
    existence of numberless worlds in space illimitable. His originality lies in the
    clear and comprehensive notion he formed of the Copernican discovery, and in his
    application of its corollaries to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
    id="page173"></a>{173}</span> Renaissance apocalypse of deified nature and
    emancipated man. The deductions he drew were so manifold and so acute that they
    enabled him to forecast the course which human thought has followed in all provinces
    of speculation.</p>
    <p>This leads us to consider how Bruno is related to modern science and philosophy.
    The main point seems to be that he obtained a vivid mental picture
    (<i>Vorstellung</i>) of the physical universe, differing but little in essentials
    from that which has now come to be generally accepted. In reasoning from this concept
    as a starting-point, he formed opinions upon problems of theology, ontology, biology
    and psychology, which placed him out of harmony with medaeival thought, and in
    agreement with the thought of our own time. Why this was so, can easily be explained.
    Bruno, first of all philosophers, adapted science, in the modern sense of that term,
    to metaphysic. He was the first to perceive that a revolution in our conception of
    the material universe, so momentous as that effected by Copernicus, necessitated a
    new theology and a new philosophical method. Man had ceased to be the center of all
    things; this globe was no longer 'the hub of the universe,' but a small speck
    floating on infinity. The Christian scheme of the Fall and the Redemption, if not
    absolutely incompatible with the new cosmology was rendered by it less conceivable in
    any literal sense. Some of the main points on which the early Christians based their
    faith, and which had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"
    id="page174"></a>{174}</span> hardened into dogmas through the course of
    centuries&mdash;such, for instance, as the Ascension and the Second
    Advent&mdash;ceased to have their old significance. In a world where there was
    neither up nor down, the translation of a corporeal Deity to some place above the
    clouds, whence he would descend to judge men at the last day, had only a grotesque or
    a symbolic meaning; whereas to the first disciples, imbued with theories of a fixed
    celestial sphere, it presented a solemn and apparently well-founded expectation. The
    fundamental doctrine of the Incarnation, in like manner, lost intelligibility and
    value, when God had to be thought no longer as the Creator of a finite cosmos, but as
    a Being commensurate with infinity. It was clear to a mind so acute as Bruno's that
    the dogmas of the Church were correlated to a view of the world which had been
    superseded; and he drew the logical inference that they were at bottom but poetical
    and popular adumbrations of the Deity in terms concordant with erroneous physical
    notions. Aristotle and Ptolemy, the masters of philosophy and cosmography based upon
    a theory of the universe as finite and circumscribed within fixed limits, lent
    admirable aid to the theological constructions of the Middle Ages. The Church,
    adopting their science, gave metaphysical and logical consistency to those earlier
    poetical and popular conceptions of the religious sense. The <i>na&iuml;f</i> hopes
    and romantic mythologies of the first Christians stiffened into syllogisms and
    ossified in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> the
    huge fabric of the <i>Summa</i>. But Aristotle and Ptolemy were now dethroned. Bruno,
    in a far truer sense than Democritus before him,</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="i24">extra<br />
        </span> <span>Processit longe flammantia moenia mundi.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Bolder even than Copernicus, and nearer in his intuition to the truth, he denied
    that the universe had 'flaming walls' or any walls at all. That 'immaginata
    circonferenza,' 'quella margine immaginata del cielo,' on which antique science and
    Christian theology alike reposed, was the object of his ceaseless satire, his
    oft-repeated polemic. What, then, rendered Bruno the precursor of modern thought in
    its various manifestations, was that he grasped the fundamental truth upon which
    modern science rests, and foresaw the conclusions which must be drawn from it. He
    speculated boldly, incoherently, vehemently; but he speculated with a clear
    conception of the universe, as we still apprehend it. Through the course of three
    centuries we have been engaged in verifying the guesses, deepening, broadening and
    solidifying the hypotheses, which Bruno's extension of the Copernican theory, and his
    application of it to pure thought, suggested to his penetrating and audacious
    intellect, Bruno was convinced that religion in its higher essence would not suffer
    from the new philosophy. Larger horizons extended before the human intellect. The
    soul expanded in more exhilarating regions than the old theologies had offered. The
    sense of the Divine in Nature, instead of dwindling down <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page176" id="page176"></a>{176}</span> to atheism, received fresh stimulus from
    the immeasurable prospect of an infinite and living universe. Bruno, even more than
    Spinoza, was a God-intoxicated man. The inebriation of the Renaissance, inspired by
    golden visions of truth and knowledge close within man's grasp, inflamed with joy at
    escaping from out-worn wearying formula into what appeared to be the simple intuition
    of an everlasting verity, pulses through all his utterances. He has the same cherubic
    confidence in the renascent age, that charms us in the work of Rabelais. The slow,
    painful, often thwarted, ever more dubious elaboration of modern metaphysic in
    <i>rapport</i> with modern science&mdash;that process which, after completing the
    cycle of all knowledge and sounding the fathomless depth of all ignorance, has left
    us in grave disillusionment and sturdy patience&mdash;swam before Bruno in a
    rapturous vision. The Inquisition and the stake put an end abruptly to his dream. But
    the dream was so golden, so divine, that it was worth the pangs of martyrdom. Can we
    say the same for Hegel's system, or for Schopenhauers or for the encyclopaedic
    ingenuity of Herbert Spencer?</p>
    <p>Bruno imagined the universe as infinite space, filled with ether, in which an
    infinite number of worlds, or solar systems resembling our own, composed of similar
    materials and inhabited by countless living creatures, move with freedom. The whole
    of this infinite and complex cosmos he conceived to be animated by a single principle
    of thought and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>{177}</span>
    life. This indwelling force, or God, he described in Platonic phraseology sometimes
    as the Anima Mundi, sometimes as the Artificer, who by working from within molds
    infinite substance into an infinity of finite modes. Though we are compelled to think
    of the world under the two categories of spirit and matter, these apparently
    contradictory constituents are forever reconciled and harmonized in the divine
    existence, whereof illimitable activity, illimitable volition, and illimitable
    potentiality are correlated and reciprocally necessary terms. In Aristotelian
    language, Bruno assumed infinite form and infinite matter as movements of an eternal
    process, by which the infinite unity manifests itself in concrete reality. This being
    the case, it follows that nothing exists which has not life, and is not part of God.
    The universe itself is one immeasurable animal, or animated Being. The solar systems
    are huge animals; the globes are lesser animals; and so forth down to the monad of
    molecular cohesion. As the universe is infinite and eternal, motion, place and time
    do not qualify it; these are terms applicable only to the finite parts of which it is
    composed. For the same reason nothing in the universe can perish. What we call birth
    and death, generation and dissolution, is only the passage of the infinite, and
    homogeneous entity through successive phases of finite and differentiated existence;
    this continuous process of exchange and transformation being stimulated and sustained
    by attraction and repulsion, pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"
    id="page178"></a>{178}</span> perties of the indwelling divine soul aiming at
    self-realization.</p>
    <p>Having formed this conception, Bruno supported it by metaphysical demonstration,
    and deduced conclusions bearing on psychology, religion, ethics. Much of his polemic
    was directed against the deeply-rooted notion of a finite world derived from
    Aristotle. Much was devoted to the proof of the Copernican discovery. Orthodox
    theology was indirectly combated or plausibly caressed. There are consequently many
    pages in his dialogues which do not interest a modern reader, seeing that we have
    outlived the conditions of thought that rendered them important. In the process of
    his argument, he established the theory of a philosophical belief, a religion of
    religions, or 'religione della mente,' as he phrased it, prior to and comprehensive
    of all historical creeds. He speculated, as probabilities, the transmigration of
    souls, and the interchangeability of types in living creatures. He further postulated
    a concordance between the order of thought and the order of existence in the
    universe, and inclined to the doctrine of necessity in morals. Bruno thus obtained
    <i>per saltum</i> a prospect over the whole domain of knowledge subsequently
    traversed by rationalism in metaphysics, theology and ethics. In the course of these
    demonstrations and deductions he anticipated Descartes' position of the identity of
    mind and being. He supplied Spinoza with the substance of his reasoned pantheism;
    Leibnitz with his theory <span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"
    id="page179"></a>{179}</span> of monadism and pre-established harmony. He laid down
    Hegel's doctrine of contraries, and perceived that thought was a dialectic process.
    The modern theory of evolution was enunciated by him in pretty plain terms. He had
    grasped the physical law of the conservation of energy. He solved the problem of evil
    by defining it to be a relative condition of imperfect development. He denied that
    Paradise or a Golden Age is possible for man, or that, if possible, it can be
    considered higher in the moral scale than organic struggle toward completion by
    reconciliation of opposites through pain and labor. He sketched in outline the
    comparative study of religions, which is now beginning to be recognized as the proper
    basis for theology. Finally, he had a firm and vital hold upon that supreme
    speculation of the universe, considered no longer as the battle-ground of dual
    principles, or as the finite fabric of an almighty designer, but as the
    self-effectuation of an infinite unity, appearing to our intelligence as spirit and
    matter&mdash;that speculation which in one shape or another controls the course of
    modern thought.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> It must not
    be supposed that Bruno apprehended these points with distinctness, or that he
    expressed them precisely in the forms with which we are familiar. The hackneyed
    metaphor of a Pisgah view across the promised land applies to him with singular
    propriety. Moreover, as an acute critic has remarked, things old and new are so
    curiously blended in his writings that what at first sight appears modern, is often
    found upon reflection to be antique, and what is couched in obsolete scholastic
    terminology, turns out upon analysis to contain the germs of advanced theories.<a
    name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126"
    class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The peculiar forms adapted for the exposition of his
    thoughts contribute to the difficulty of obtaining a methodical view of Bruno's
    philosophy. It has, therefore, been disputed whether he was a pantheist or an
    atheist, a materialist or a spiritualist, a mystic or an agnostic. No one would have
    contended more earnestly than Bruno himself, that the sage can hold each and all of
    these apparent contradictions together, with the exception of atheism; which last is
    a simple impossibility. The fragmentary and impassioned exposition which Bruno gave
    to his opinions in a series of Italian dialogues and Latin poems will not discourage
    those of his admirers who estimate the conspicuous failure made by all elaborate
    system-builders from Aristotle to Hegel. To fathom the mystery of the world, and to
    express that mystery in terms of logic, is clearly beyond the faculty of man.
    Phil<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>{181}</span> osophies
    that aim at universe-embracing, God-explaining, nature-elucidating, man-illuminating,
    comprehensiveness, have justly, therefore, become objects of suspicion. The utmost
    that man can do, placed as he is at obvious disadvantages for obtaining a complete
    survey of the whole, is to whet his intelligence upon confessedly insoluble problems,
    to extend the sphere of his practical experience, to improve his dominion over
    matter, to study the elevation of his moral nature, and to encourage himself for
    positive achievements by the indulgence in those glorious dreams from which
    regenerative creeds and inspiring philosophies have sprung&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Still climbing after knowledge infinite,<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Faith and poetry are the highest regions in which his spirit can profitably move.
    The study of government, law, and social ethics, the analysis of physical conditions
    to which he is subject, and over which he has an undefined, though limited, control,
    form the practical sphere of his intelligence. Bruno traversed these regions; and,
    forasmuch as the outcome of his exploration was no system, but a congeries of poetic
    visions, shrewd guesses, profound intuitions, and passionate enthusiasms, bound
    together and sustained by a burning sense of the Divine unity in nature and in man,
    we may be permitted to regard him as more fortunate than those cloud-castle-builders
    whose classifications of absolute existences are successively proved by the advance
    of relative know<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>{182}</span>
    ledge to be but catalogues of some few objects apprehended by the vision of each
    partially-instructed age. We have, indeed, reason to marvel how many of Bruno's
    intuitions have formed the stuff of later, more elaborated systems, and still remain
    the best which these contain. We have reason to wonder how many of his divinations
    have worked themselves into the common fund of modern beliefs, and have become
    philosophical truisms.</p>
    <p>It is probable that if Bruno's career had not been cut short by the dungeon and
    the stake at the early age of thirty-four, he might have produced some final work in
    which his theories would have assumed a formal shape. It is possible that the Vatican
    even now contains the first sketch for such a studied exposition in the treatise on
    the Seven Arts, which Giovanni Mocenigo handed over to the Inquisition, and which the
    philosopher intended to dedicate to Clement VIII. But the loss of this elaborated
    system is hardly to be regretted, except for the clearer light it must have thrown
    upon the workings of the most illuminated intellect in the sixteenth century. We know
    that it could not have revealed to us the secret of things.</p>
    <p>Bruno cast his thoughts in two molds: the dialogue, and Latin hexameters. He was
    attracted to the latter by his early study of Parmenides and Lucretius. The former
    seems to have been natural to the man. We must not forget that he was a Neapolitan,
    accustomed from childhood to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"
    id="page183"></a>{183}</span> the farces of his native land, vividly alive to the
    comic aspects of existence, and joyously appreciative of reality. His first known
    composition was a comedy, <i>Il Candelajo</i>; and something of the drama can be
    traced in all those Italian compositions which distinguish the period of his activity
    as an author in London. Lucian rather than Plato or Cicero determined the form of his
    dialogue. An element of the burlesque distinguishes his method of approaching
    religious and moral problems in the <i>Spaccio della Bestia</i>, and the <i>Cavallo
    Pegaseo</i>. And though he exchanged the manner of his model for more serious
    exposition in the trio of metaphysical dialogues, named <i>La Cena delle Ceneri,
    Della Causa</i>, and <i>Dell' Infinito Universo</i>, yet the irresistible tendency to
    dramatic satire emerges even there in the description of England and in the
    characters of the indispensable pedant buffoon. His dialogue on the <i>Eroici
    Furori</i> is sustained at a high pitch of aspiring fervor. Mystical in its attempt
    to adumbrate the soul's thirst for truth and beauty, it adopts the method of a
    running commentary upon poems, in the manner of a discursive and fantastic <i>Vita
    Nuova</i>. In his Italian style, Bruno owed much to the fashion set by Aretino. The
    study of Aretino's comedies is apparent in <i>Il Candelajo</i>. The stringing
    together of words and ideas in triplets, balanced by a second set of words and ideas
    in antithetical triplets&mdash;this trick of rhetoric, which wearies a modern reader
    of his prose, seems to have been copied straight from<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page184" id="page184"></a>{184}</span> Aretino. The coinage of fantastic
    titles, of which <i>Lo Spaccio della Bestia Trionfante</i> contributed in some
    appreciable degree to Bruno's martyrdom, should be ascribed to the same influence.
    The source of these literary affectations was a bad one. Aretino, Doni, and such folk
    were no fit masters for Giordano Bruno even in so slight a matter as artistic form.
    Yet, in this respect, he shared a corrupt taste which was common to his generation,
    and proved how fully he represented the age in which he lived. It is not improbable
    that the few contemporary readers of his works, especially in euphuistic England,
    admired the gewgaws he so plentifully scattered and rendered so brilliant by the
    coruscations of his wit. When, however, the real divine oestrum descends upon him, he
    discards those follies. Then his language, like his thought, is all his own: sublime,
    impassioned, burning, turbid; instinct with a deep volcanic fire of genuine
    enthusiasm. The thought is simple; the diction direct; the attitude of mind and the
    turn of expression are singularly living, surprisingly modern. We hear the man speak,
    as he spoke at Fulke Greville's supper-party, as he spoke at Oxford, as he spoke
    before the Sorbonne, as he might be speaking now. There is no air of literary effort,
    no tincture of antiquated style, in these masculine utterances.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Fra Paolo was the son of Francesco Sarpi and Isabella Morelli, Venetians of the
    humbler middle class. He was born in 1552, christened Pietro, and nicknamed Pierino
    because of his diminutive stature. On entering the Order of the Servites he adopted
    the religious name of Paolo, which he subsequently rendered famous throughout Europe.
    Since he died in 1623, Sarpi's life coincided with a period of supreme interest and
    manifold vicissitudes in the decline of Venice. After the battle of Lepanto in 1571,
    he saw the nobles of S. Mark welcome their victorious admiral Sebastiano Veniero and
    confer on him the honors of the Dogeship. In 1606, he aided the Republic to withstand
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>{186}</span> thunders of
    the Vatican and defy the excommunication of a Pope. Eight years later he attended at
    those councils of state which unmasked the conspiracy, known as Bedmar's, to destroy
    Venice. In his early manhood Cyprus had been wrested from the hands of S. Mark; and
    inasmuch as the Venetians alone sustained the cause of Christian civilization against
    Turk and pirate in the Eastern seas, he was able before his death to anticipate the
    ruin which the war of Candia subsequently brought upon his country. During the last
    eighteen years of his existence Sarpi was the intellect of the Republic; the man of
    will and mind who gave voice and vigor to her policy of independence; the statesman
    who most clearly penetrated the conditions of her strength and weakness. This friar
    incarnated the Venetian spirit at a moment when, upon the verge of decadence, it had
    attained self-consciousness; and so instinctively devoted are Venetians to their
    State that in his lifetime he was recognized by them as hero, and after his death
    venerated as saint.</p>
    <p>No sooner had the dispute with Paul V. been compromised, than Sarpi noticed how
    the aristocracy of Venice yielded themselves to sloth and political indifference. The
    religious obsequiousness to Rome and the 'peace or rather cowardice of slaves,' which
    were gradually immersing Italy in mental torpor and luxurious idleness, invaded this
    last stronghold of freedom. Though Sarpi's Christian Stoicism and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>{187}</span> practical sagacity
    saved him from playing the then futile part of public agitator, his private
    correspondence shows how low his hope had sunk for Italy. Nothing but a general war
    could free her from the yoke of arrogant Rome and foreign despotism. Meanwhile the
    Papal Court, Spain and the House of Austria, having everything to lose by contest,
    preserved the peace of Italy at any cost. Princes whose petty thrones depended on
    Spanish and Papal good-will, dreaded to disturb the equilibrium of servitude; the
    population, dulled by superstition, emasculated by Jesuitical corruption and
    intimidated by Church tyranny, slumbered in the gross mud-honey of slavish pleasures.
    From his cell in the convent of the Servites Sarpi swept the whole political horizon,
    eagerly anticipating some dawn-star of deliverance. At one time his eyes rested on
    the Duke of Savoy, but that unquiet spirit failed to steer his course clear between
    Spanish and French interests, Roman jealousies, and the ill-concealed hostilities of
    Italian potentates. At another time, like all lovers of freedom throughout Europe, he
    looked with confidence to Henri IV. But a fanatic's dagger, sharpened by the Jesuits,
    cut short the monarch's life and gave up France to the government of astute
    Florentine adventurers. Germany was too distracted by internal dissensions, Holland
    too distant and preoccupied with her own struggle for existence, to offer immediate
    aid. It was in vain that Sarpi told his foreign correspondents that the war of
    liberty <span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>{188}</span> in
    Europe must be carried into the stronghold of absolutism. To secure a victory over
    the triple forces of Spain, the Papal Court and Jesuitry, Rome had to be attacked in
    Italy. His reasoning was correct. But peoples fighting for freedom on their native
    soil could not risk an adventure which only some central power of the first magnitude
    like France might have conducted with fair prospect of success. In the meantime what
    Sarpi called the Diacatholicon, that absolutist alliance of Rome, Spain and Austria,
    supported by the Inquisition and the Jesuits, accepted by the states of Italy and
    firmly rooted in some parts of Germany, invaded even those provinces where the
    traditions of independence still survived. After 1610 the Jesuits obtained possession
    of France; and though they did not effect their re-entrance into Venice, the ruling
    classes of the Republic allowed themselves to be drugged by the prevalent narcotic.
    Venice, too, was fighting for her life in the Adriatic and the Levant, while her
    nobles became daily more supine in aristocratic leisure, more papalizing in their
    private sympathies. Thus the last years of Sarpi's life were overclouded by a deep
    discouragement, which did not, indeed, extinguish his trust in the divine Providence
    or his certain belief that the right would ultimately prevail, but which adds a
    tragic interest to the old age of this champion of political and moral liberty fallen
    on evil days.</p>
    <p>I have thought it well to preface what I have to say about Sarpi with this
    forecast of his final attitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"
    id="page189"></a>{189}</span> As the Italian who most clearly comprehended the full
    consequences of the Catholic Revival, and who practically resisted what was evil for
    his nation in that reactionary movement, he demands a prominent place in this book.
    On his claims to scientific discoveries and his special service rendered to the
    Venetian Republic it will suffice to touch but lightly.</p>
    <p>Sarpi's father was short of stature, brown-complexioned, choleric and restless.
    His mother was tall, pale, lymphatic, devoted to religious exercises and austerities.
    The son of their ill-assorted wedlock inherited something of both temperaments. In
    his face and eyes he resembled his mother; and he derived from her the piety which
    marked his course through life. His short, spare person, his vivid, ever-active
    intellect testified to the paternal impress. This blending of two diverse strains
    produced in him a singular tenacity of fiber. Man's tenement of clay has rarely
    lodged a spirit so passionless, so fine, so nearly disembodied. Of extreme physical
    tenuity, but gifted with inexhaustible mental energy, indefatigable in study,
    limitless in capacity for acquiring and retaining knowledge, he accentuated the type
    which nature gave him by the sustained habits of a lifetime. In diet he abstained
    from flesh and abhorred wine. His habitual weaknesses were those of one who subdues
    the body to mental government. As costive as Scaliger,<a name="FNanchor_127_127"
    id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
    Sarpi suffered from hepa<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"
    id="page190"></a>{190}</span> tic hemorrhage, retention of urine, prolapsus recti,
    and hemorrhoids. Intermittent fevers reduced his strength, but rarely interfered with
    his activity. He refused to treat himself as an invalid, never altered his course of
    life for any illness, and went about his daily avocations when men of laxer tissue
    would have taken to their bed. His indifference to danger was that of the Stoic or
    the Mussulman. During a period of fifteen years he knew that restless foes were
    continually lying in wait to compass his death by poison or the dagger. Yet he could
    hardly be persuaded to use the most ordinary precautions. 'I am resolved,' he wrote,
    in 1609, 'to give no thought whatever to these wretchednesses. He who thinks too much
    of living knows not how to live well. One is bound to die once; to be curious about
    the day or place or manner of dying is unprofitable. Whatsoever is God's will is
    good.'<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> As fear had no hold upon his
    nature, so was he wholly free from the dominion of the senses. A woman's name, if we
    except that of the Queen of France, is, I think, not once mentioned in his
    correspondence. Even natural affections seem to have been obliterated; for he records
    nothing of his mother or his father or a sister who survived their deaths. One suit
    of clothes sufficed him; and his cell was furnished with three hour-glasses, a
    picture of Christ in the Garden, and a crucifix raised above a human skull.</p>
    <p>His physical sensitiveness, developed by austerity of life, was <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>{191}</span> of the highest
    acuteness. Sight, touch, and taste in him acquired the most exquisite delicacy. He
    was wont to say that he feared no poison in his food, since he could discriminate the
    least adulteration of natural flavors. His mental perspicacity was equally subtle. As
    a boy he could recite thirty lines of Virgil after hearing them read over once. Books
    were not so much perused by him as penetrated at a glance; and what he had but
    casually noticed, never afterwards escaped his memory. In the vast Venetian archives
    he could lay his hand on any document without referring to registers or catalogues.
    The minutest details of houses visited or places passed through, remained indelibly
    engraved upon his memory. The characters of men lay open to his insight through their
    physiognomy and gestures. When new scientific instruments were submitted to his
    curiosity, he divined their uses and comprehended their mechanism without effort.
    Thus endowed with a rare combination of physical and intellectual faculties, it is no
    wonder that Sarpi became one of the most learned men of his age or of any age. He was
    an excellent Greek, Latin, and Hebrew scholar; an adequate master of the French and
    Spanish languages; profoundly versed in canon and civil law; accomplished in the
    erudition of classical and scholastic philosophy; thoroughly acquainted with secular
    and ecclesiastical history. Every branch of mathematics and natural science had been
    explored by him with the enthusiasm of a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"
    id="page192"></a>{192}</span> pioneer. He made experiments in chemistry, mechanics,
    mineralogy, metallurgy, vegetable and animal physiology. His practical studies in
    anatomy were carried on by the aid of vivisection. Following independent paths, he
    worked out some of Gilbert's discoveries in magnetism, and of Da Porta's in optics,
    demonstrated the valves of the veins, and the function of the uvea in vision, divined
    the uses of the telescope and thermometer. When he turned his attention to astronomy,
    he at once declared the futility of judicial astrology; and while recognizing the
    validity of Galileo's system, predicted that this truth would involve its promulgator
    in serious difficulties with the Roman Inquisition. In his treatises on psychology
    and metaphysics, he originated a theory of sensationalism akin to that of Locke.
    There was, in fact, no field of knowledge which he had not traversed with the energy
    of a discoverer. Only to poetry and <i>belles lettres</i> he paid but little heed,
    disdaining the puerilities of rhetoric then in vogue, and using language as the
    simplest vehicle of thought. In conversation he was reticent, speaking little, but
    always to the purpose, and rather choosing to stimulate his collocutors than to make
    display of eloquence or erudition. Yet his company was eagerly sought, and he
    delighted in the society, not only of learned men and students, but of travelers,
    politicians, merchants, and citizens of the world. His favorite places of resort were
    the saloons of Andrea Morosini, and the shop of the Secchini at the sign of the Nave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>{193}</span> d'Oro. Here,
    after days spent in religious exercises, sacerdotal duties, and prolonged studies, he
    relaxed his mind in converse with the miscellaneous crowd of eminent persons who
    visited Venice for business or pleasure. A certain subacid humor, combining irony
    without bitterness, and proverbial pungency without sententiousness, added piquancy
    to his discourse. We have, unfortunately, no record of the wit-encounters which may
    have taken place under Morosini's or Secchini's roof between this friar, so punctual
    in his religious observances, so scrupulously pure in conduct, so cold in
    temperament, so acute in intellect, so modest in self-esteem, so cautious, so
    impermeable, and his contemporary, Bruno, the unfrocked friar of genius more daring
    but less sure, who was mentally in all points, saving their common love of truth and
    freedom, the opposite to Sarpi.</p>
    <p>Sarpi entered the Order of the Servi, or Servants of the Blessed Virgin, at the
    age of fourteen, renewed his vows at twenty, and was ordained priest at twenty-two.<a
    name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129"
    class="fnanchor">[129]</a> His great worth brought him early into notice, and he
    filled posts of considerable importance in his Order. Several years of his manhood
    were spent in Rome, transacting the business and <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span> conducting the legal causes of the
    Fathers. At Mantua he gained the esteem of Guglielmo Gonzaga. At Milan he was
    admitted to familiar intimacy with the sainted Carlo Borromeo, who consulted him upon
    matters of reform in the diocese, and insisted on his hearing confessions. This duty
    was not agreeable to Sarpi; and though he habitually in after life said Mass and
    preached, he abstained from those functions of the priesthood which would have
    brought him into close relation with individuals. The bent of his mind rendered him
    averse to all forms of superstition and sacerdotal encroachments upon the freedom of
    the conscience. As he fought the battle of political independence against
    ecclesiastical aggression, so he maintained the prerogatives of personal liberty. The
    arts whereby Jesuits gained hold on families and individuals, inspired in him no less
    disgust than the illegal despotism of the Papacy. This blending of sincere piety and
    moral rectitude with a passion for secular freedom and a hatred of priestly craft,
    has something in it closely akin to the English temperament. Sarpi was a sound
    Catholic Christian in religion, and in politics what we should call a staunch Whig.
    So far as it is now possible to penetrate his somewhat baffling personality, we might
    compare him to a Macaulay of finer edge, to a Dean Stanley of more vigorous build. He
    was less commonplace than the one, more substantial than the other. But we must be
    cautious in offering any interpretation of his real opinions. It was <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>{195}</span> not for nothing that
    he dedicated himself to the monastic life in boyhood, and persevered in it to the end
    of his long career. The discipline of the convent renders every friar inscrutable;
    and Sarpi himself assured his friends that he, like all Italians of his day, was
    bound to wear a mask.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>
    <p>Be this as it may, Sarpi was not the man to work his way by monkish intrigue or
    courtly service into high place either in his Order or the Church. Long before he
    unsheathed the sword in defense of Venetian liberties, he had become an object of
    suspicion to Rome and his superiors. Some frank words which escaped him in
    correspondence, regarding the corruption of the Papal Curia, closed every avenue to
    office. Men of less mark obtained the purple. The meanest and poorest bishoprics were
    refused to Sarpi. He was thrice denounced, on frivolous charges, to the Inquisition;
    but on each occasion the indictment was dismissed without a hearing. The General of
    the Servites accused him of wearing cap and slippers uncanonical in cut, and of not
    reciting the <i>Salve Regina</i>. After a solemn trial, Sarpi was acquitted; and it
    came to be proverbially whispered that 'even the slippers of the incorruptible Fra
    Paolo had been canonized.' Being a sincere Catholic at heart, as well as a man of
    profound learning and prudent speech, his papalistic enemies could get no grip upon
    him. Yet they instinctively hated and dreaded one whom they felt to be opposed, in
    his strength, fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"
    id="page196"></a>{196}</span> lessness and freedom of soul, to their exorbitant
    pretensions and underhand aggressions upon public liberties. His commerce with
    heretics both in correspondence with learned Frenchmen and in conversation with
    distinguished foreigners at Venice, was made a ground of accusation, and Clement
    VIII. declared that this alone sufficed to exclude him from any dignity in the
    Church.</p>
    <p>It does not appear that Sarpi troubled his head about these things. Had he cared
    for power, there was no distinction to which he might not have aspired by stooping to
    common arts and by compromising his liberty of conscience. But he was indifferent to
    rank and wealth. Public business he discharged upon occasion from a sense of duty to
    his Order. For the rest, so long as he was left to pursue his studies in
    tranquillity, Sarpi had happiness enough; and his modesty was so great that he did
    not even seek to publish the results of his discoveries in science. For this reason
    they have now been lost to the world; only the memory of them surviving in the notes
    of Foscarini and Grisellini, who inspected his MSS. before they were accidentally
    destroyed by fire in 1769.</p>
    <p>Though renowned through Europe as the <i>orbis terrae ocellus</i>, the man sought
    out by every visitor to Venice as the rarest citizen of the Republic, Sarpi might
    have quitted this earthly scene with only the faint fame of a thinker whose eminent
    gifts blossomed in obscurity, had it not been for a public opportunity which forced
    him to forsake his studies and his cell <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
    id="page197"></a>{197}</span> for a place at the Council-board and for the functions
    of a polemical writer. That robust manliness of mind, which makes an Englishman hail
    English virtues in Sarpi, led him to affirm that 'every man of excellence is bound to
    pay attention to politics.'<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Yet politics were not his special
    sphere. Up to the age of fifty-four he ripened in the assiduous studies of which I
    have made mention, in the discharge of his official duties as a friar, and his
    religious duties as a priest. He had distinguished himself amid the practical affairs
    of life by judicial acuteness, unswerving justice, infallible perspicacity, and
    inexhaustible stores of erudition brought to bear with facility on every detail of
    any matter in dispute. But nature and inclination seemed to mark him out through
    early manhood for experimental and speculative science rather than for action. Now a
    demand was made on his deep fount of energy, which evolved the latent forces of a
    character unique in many-sided strength. He had dedicated himself to religion and to
    the pursuit of knowledge. But he was a Venetian of the Venetians, the very soul of
    Venice. After God, his Prince and the Republic claimed obedience; and when S. Mark
    called, Sarpi abandoned science for the service of his country. 'Singularly composed
    of active and contemplative energies was the life of our Father; yielding to God that
    which he was able, to his Prince that which duty dictated, and to the domain of
    Venice more than any law but that of love demanded.'<a name="FNanchor_132_132"
    id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a><span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span></p>
    <p>Paul V. assumed the tiara with the fixed resolve of making good the Papal claims
    to supremacy. Between Venice and the Holy See numerous disputed points of
    jurisdiction, relating to the semi-ecclesiastical fief of Ceneda, the investiture of
    the Patriarch, the navigation of the Po, and the right of the Republic to exercise
    judgment in criminal cases affecting priests, offered this Pope opportunities of
    interference. The Venetians maintained their customary prerogatives; and in April
    1606 Paul laid them under interdict and excommunication. The Republic denied the
    legitimacy of this proceeding. The Doge, Leonardo Donato, issued a proclamation to
    the clergy of all degrees within the domain, appealing to their loyalty and enjoining
    on them the discharge of their sacerdotal duties in spite of the Papal interdict.
    Only Jesuits at first disobeyed the ducal mandate. When they refused to say Mass in
    the excommunicated city, they were formally expelled as contumacious subjects; and
    the fathers took ship amid the maledictions of the populace: '<i>Andate in
    malora</i>.' Their example was subsequently followed by the reformed Capuchins and
    the Theatines. Otherwise the Venetian clergy, like the people, remained firm in their
    allegiance to the state. 'We are Venetians first, Christians afterwards,' was a
    proverb dating from this incident. Venice, conscious of the justice of her cause,
    prepared to resist the Pope's arrogant demands if need were with arms, and to
    exercise religious rites within her towns in spite of Camillo Borghese's <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>{199}</span> excommunication. The
    Senate, some time before these events happened, had perceived the advantage which
    would accrue to the Republic from the service of a practised Canonist and
    jurisprudent in ecclesiastical affairs. Sarpi attracted their attention at an early
    stage of the dispute by a memorial which he drew up and presented to the Doge upon
    the best means of repelling Papal aggression. After perusing his report, in the month
    of January 1606, they appointed him Theologian and Canonist to the Republic, with a
    yearly salary of 200 ducats. This post he occupied until his death, having at a later
    period been raised to the still more important office of Counselor of State, which
    eventually he filled alone without a single coadjutor.</p>
    <p>From the month of January 1606, for the remaining seventeen years of his life,
    Sarpi was intellectually the most prominent personage of Venice, the man who for the
    world at large represented her policy of moderate but firm resistance to
    ecclesiastical tyranny. Greatness had been thrust upon the modest and retiring
    student; and Father Paul's name became the watchword of political independence
    throughout Europe.</p>
    <p>The Jesuists acting in concert with Spain, as well-informed historians held
    certain, first inspired Camillo Borghese with his ill-considered attempt upon the
    liberties of Venice.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It was now the Jesuits, after
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>{200}</span> their expulsion
    from the Republic, who opened the batteries of literary warfare against the Venetian
    government. They wrote and published manifestoes through the Bergamasque territory,
    which province acknowledged the episcopal jurisdiction of Milan, though it belonged
    to the Venetian domain. In these writings it was argued that, so long as the Papal
    interdict remained in force, all sacraments would be invalid, marriages null, and
    offspring illegitimate. The population, trained already in doctrines of Papal
    supremacy, were warned that should they remain loyal to a contumacious State, their
    own souls would perish through the lack of sacerdotal ministrations, and their
    posterity would roam the world as bastards and accursed. To traverse this argument of
    sarcerdotal tyranny, exorbitant in any age of the Latin Church, but preposterous
    after the illumination of the sixteenth century in Europe, was a citizen's plain
    duty. Sarpi therefore supplied an elegant Italian stylist, Giambattista Leoni, with
    material for setting forth a statement of the controversy between Venice and Rome. It
    would have been well if he had taken up the pen with his own hand. But at this early
    period of his career as publicist, he seems to have been diffident about his literary
    powers. The result was that Leoni's main defense of the Republic fell flat; and the
    war was waged for a while upon side issues. Sarpi drew a treatise by Gerson, the
    learned French champion of Catholic independence, forth from the dust of libraries,
    trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>{201}</span> lated it
    into Italian, and gave it to the press accompanied by an introductory letter which he
    signed.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> Cardinal Bellarmino responded
    from Rome with an attack on Sarpi's orthodoxy and Gerson's authority. Sarpi replied
    in an Apology for Gerson. Then, finding that Leoni's narrative had missed its mark,
    he poured forth pamphlet upon pamphlet, penning his own <i>Considerations on the
    Censures</i>, inspiring Fra Fulgenzio Micanzi with a work styled
    <i>Confirmations</i>, and finally reducing the whole matter of the controversy into a
    book entitled a <i>Treatise on the Interdict</i>, which he signed together with six
    brother theologians of the Venetian party. It is not needful in this place to
    institute a minute investigation into the merits of this pamphlet warfare. In its
    details, whether we regard the haughty claims of delegated omnipotence advanced by
    Rome, or the carefully studied historical and canonistic arguments built up by Sarpi,
    the quarrel has lost actuality. Common sense and freedom have so far conquered in
    Europe that Sarpi's opinions, then denounced as heresies, sound now like truisms; and
    his candid boast that he was the first to break the neck of Papal encroachments upon
    secular prerogative, may pass for insignificant in an age which has little to fear
    from ecclesiastical violence.</p>
    <p>Yet we must not forget that, during the first <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page202" id="page202"></a>{202}</span> years of the seventeenth century, the
    Venetian conflict with Papal absolutism, considered merely as a test-case in
    international jurisprudence, was one of vitally important interest. When we reflect
    how the Catholic Alliance was then engaged in rolling back the tide of Reformation,
    how the forces of Rome had been rallied by the Tridentine Council, and how the
    organism of the Jesuits had been created to promulgate new dogmas of Papal
    almightiness in Church and State, this resistance of Venice, stoutly Catholic in
    creed, valiant in her defense of Christendom against the Moslem, supported by her
    faithful churchman and accomplished canonist, was no inconsiderable factor in the
    European strife for light and liberty. The occasion was one of crucial gravity.
    Reconstituted Rome had not as yet been brought into abrupt collision with any
    commonwealth which abode in her communion. Had Venice yielded in that issue, the
    Papacy might have augured for itself a general victory. That Venice finally submitted
    to Roman influence, while preserving the semblance of independence, detracts, indeed,
    from the importance of this Interdict-affair considered as an episode in the struggle
    for spiritual freedom. Moreover, we know now that the presumptuous pretensions of the
    Papacy at large were destined, before many years had passed, to be pared down,
    diminished and obliterated by the mere advance of intellectual enlightenment. Yet
    none of these considerations diminish Sarpi's claim to rank as hero in <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> the forefront of a
    battle which in his time was being waged with still uncertain prospects.<a
    name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135"
    class="fnanchor">[135]</a> In their comparatively narrow spheres Venice and Sarpi,
    not less than Holland, England, Sweden and the Protestants of Germany, on their wider
    platform at a later date, were fighting for a principle upon which the liberty of
    States depended. And they were the first to fight for it upon the ground most
    perilous to the common adversary. In all his writings Sarpi sought to prove that men
    might remain sound Catholics and yet resist Roman aggression; that the Roman Court
    and its modern champions had introduced new doctrine, deviating from the pristine
    polity of Christendom; that the post-Tridentine theory of Papal absolutism was a
    deformation of that order which Christ founded, which the Apostles edified, and which
    the Councils of a purer age had built into the living temple of God's Church on
    earth.</p>
    <p>A passage from Sarpi's correspondence may be cited, as sounding the keynote to all
    his writings in this famous controversy. 'I imagine,' he writes to Jacques Gillot in
    1609, 'that the State and the Church are two realms, composed, however, of the same
    human beings. The one is wholly heavenly, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
    id="page204"></a>{204}</span> the other earthly. Each has its own sovereignty,
    defended by its own arms and fortifications. Nothing is held by them in common, and
    there should be no occasion for the one to declare war upon the other. Christ said
    that he and his disciples were not of this world. S. Paul affirms that our city is in
    the heavens. I take the word Church to signify an assembly of the faithful, not of
    priests only; for when we regard it as confined to those, it ceases to be Christ's
    kingdom, and becomes a portion of the commonwealth in this world, subject to the
    highest authority of State, as also are the laity.<a name="FNanchor_136_136"
    id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This
    emphatic distinction between Church and State, both fulfilling the needs of humanity
    but in diverse relations, lay at the root of Sarpi's doctrine. He regarded the claim
    of the Church to interfere in State management, not only as an infringement of the
    prince's prerogative, but also as patent rebellion against the law of God which had
    committed the temporal government of nations in sacred trust to secular rulers. As
    the State has no call to meddle in the creation and promulgation of dogmas, or to
    impose its ordinances on the religious conscience of its subjects, so the Church has
    no right to tamper with affairs of government, to accumulate wealth and arrogate
    secular power, or to withdraw its ministers from the jurisdiction of the prince in
    matters which concern the operation of criminal and civil legislature. The
    ultramontanism of the Jesuits appeared to him destructive of social <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>{205}</span> order; but, more than
    this, he considered it as impious, as a deflection from the form of Christian
    economy, as a mischievous seduction of the Church into a slough of self-annihilating
    cupidity and concupiscence.</p>
    <p>Sarpi's views seemed audacious in his own age. But they have become the
    commonplaces of posterity. We can therefore hardly do justice to the originality and
    audacity which they displayed at an epoch when only Protestants at war with Rome
    advanced the like in deadly hatred&mdash;when the Catholic pulpits of Europe were
    ringing with newly-promulgated doctrines of Papal supremacy over princes and peoples,
    of national rights to depose or assassinate excommunicated sovereigns, and of blind
    unreasoning obedience to Rome as the sole sure method of salvation. Upon the path of
    that Papal triumph toward the Capitol of world-dominion, Sarpi, the puny friar from
    his cell at Venice, rose like a specter announcing certain doom with the irrefragable
    arguments of reason. The minatory words he uttered were all the more significant
    because neither he nor the State he represented sought to break with Catholic
    traditions. His voice was terrible and mighty, inasmuch as he denounced Rome by an
    indictment which proclaimed her to be the perturbing power in Christendom, the
    troubler of Israel, the whore who poured her cup of fornications forth to sup with
    princes.</p>
    <p>After sixteen months, the quarrel of the interdict <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page206" id="page206"></a>{206}</span> was compromised. Venice, in duel with
    Islam, could ill afford to break with Rome, even if her national traditions of eight
    centuries, intertwined with rites of Latin piety, had not forbidden open rupture. The
    Papal Court, cowed into resentful silence by antagonism which threatened intellectual
    revolt through Europe, waived a portion of its claims. Three French converts from
    Huguenot opinions to Catholicism, Henri IV., the Cardinal du Perron, and M. de
    Canaye, adjusted matters. The interdict was dismissed from Venice rather than
    removed&mdash;in haughty silence, without the clashing of bells from S. Pietro di
    Castello and S. Marco, without manifestation of joy in the city which regarded Papal
    interdicts as illegitimate, without the parade of public absolution by the Pope. Thus
    the Republic maintained its dignity of self-respect. But Camillo Borghese, while
    proclaiming a general amnesty, reserved <i>in petto</i> implacable animosity against
    the theologians of the Venetian party. Two of these, Marsilio. and Rubetti, died
    suddenly under suspicion of poison.<a name="FNanchor_137_137"
    id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> A
    third, Fulgenzio Manfredi, was lured to Rome, treated with fair show of favor, and
    finally hung in the Campo di Fiora by order of the Holy Office.<a
    name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138"
    class="fnanchor">[138]</a> A fourth, Capello, abjured his so-called heresies, and was
    assigned a pittance for the last days of his failing life in Rome.<a
    name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139"
    class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It remained, if possible, to <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page207" id="page207"></a>{207}</span> lay hands on Fra Paolo and his devoted
    secretary, Fra Fulgenzio Micanzi, of the Servites.</p>
    <p>Neither threats nor promises availed to make these friends quit Venice. During the
    interdict and afterwards, Fulgenzio Micanzi preached the gospel there. He told the
    people that in the New Testament he had found truth; but he bade them take notice
    that for the laity this book was even a dead letter through the will of Rome.<a
    name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140"
    class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Paul V. complained in words like these: Fra Fulgenzio's
    doctrine contains, indeed, no patent heresy, but it rests so clearly on the Bible as
    to prejudice the Catholic faith.<a name="FNanchor_141_141"
    id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
    Sarpi informed his French correspondents that Christ and the truth had been openly
    preached in Venice by this man.<a name="FNanchor_142_142"
    id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
    Fulgenzio survived the troubles of those times, steadily devoted to his master, of
    whom he has bequeathed to posterity, a faithful portrait in that biography which
    combines the dove-like simplicity of the fourteenth century with something of Roger
    North's sagacity and humor.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Of Fulgenzio we take no further
    notice here, having paid him our debt of gratitude for genial service rendered in the
    sympathetic delineation of so eminent a character as Sarpi's. A side-regret may be
    expressed that some such simple and affectionate record <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page208" id="page208"></a>{208}</span> of Bruno as a man still fails us, and
    alas, must ever fail. Fulgenzio, by his love, makes us love Sarpi, who otherwise
    might coldly win our admiration. But for Bruno, that scapegoat of the spirit in the
    world's wilderness, there is none to speak words of worship and affection.</p>
    <p>The first definite warning that his life was in danger came to Sarpi from Caspar
    Schoppe, the publicist. Scioppius (so his contemporaries called him) was a man of
    doubtful character and unsteady principles, who, according as his interests varied,
    used a fluent pen and limpid Latin style for or against the Jesuit faction. History
    would hardly condescend to notice him but for the singular luck he had of coming at
    critical moments into contact with the three chief Italian thinkers of his time. We
    know already that a letter of this man is the one contemporary testimony of an
    eye-witness to Bruno's condemnation which we possess. He also deserves mention for
    having visited Campanella in prison and helped to procure his liberation. Now in the
    year 1607, while passing through Venice, Schoppe sought a private interview with
    Sarpi, pointed out the odium which Fra Paolo had gained in Rome by his writings, and
    concluded by asserting that the Pope meant to have him alive or to compass his
    assassination. If Sarpi wished to make his peace with Paul V., Schoppe was ready to
    conduct the reconciliation upon honorable terms, having already several affairs of
    like import in his charge. To this proposal Sarpi replied that the cause he had
    defended was a just <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
    id="page209"></a>{209}</span> one, that he had done nothing to offend his Holiness,
    and that all plots against his liberty or life he left within the hands of God. To
    these words he significantly added that, even in the Pope's grasp, a man was always
    'master over his own life'&mdash;a sentence which seems to indicate suicide as the
    last resort of self-defense. In September of the same year the Venetian ambassador at
    Rome received private information regarding some mysterious design against a person
    or persons unknown, at Venice, in which the Papal Court was implicated, and which was
    speedily to take effect.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> On October 5 Sarpi was returning
    about 5 o'clock in the afternoon to his convent at S. Fosca, when he was attacked
    upon a bridge by five ruffians. It so happened that on this occasion he had no
    attendance but his servant Fra Marino; Fra Fulgenzio and a man of courage who usually
    accompanied him, having taken another route home. The assassins were armed with
    harquebusses, pistols and poniards. One of them went straight at Sarpi, while the
    others stood on guard and held down Fra Marino. Fifteen blows in all were aimed at
    Sarpi, three of which struck him in the neck and face. The stiletto remained firmly
    embedded in his cheekbone between the right ear and nose. He fell to the ground
    senseless; and a cry being raised by some women who had witnessed the outrage from a
    window, the assassins made off, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"
    id="page210"></a>{210}</span> leaving their victim for dead. It was noticed that they
    took refuge in the palace of the Papal Nuncio, whence they escaped that same evening
    to the Lido <i>en route</i> for the States of the Church. An old Venetian nobleman of
    the highest birth, Alessandro Malipiero, who bore a singular affection for the
    champion of his country's liberty, was walking a short way in front of Sarpi beyond
    the bridge upon which the assault was perpetrated. He rushed to his friend's aid,
    dragged out the dagger from his face, and bore him to the convent. There Sarpi lay
    for many weeks in danger, suffering as much, it seems, from his physicians as from
    the wounds. Not satisfied with the attendance of his own surgeon, Alvise Ragoza, the
    Venetians insisted on sending all the eminent doctors of the city and of Padua to his
    bedside. The illustrious Acquapendente formed one of this miscellaneous
    <i>cort&egrave;ge</i>; and when the cure was completed, he received a rich gold chain
    and knighthood for his service. Every medical man suggested some fresh application.
    Some of them, suspecting poison, treated the wounds with theriac and antidotes.
    Others cut into the flesh and probed. Meanwhile the loss of blood had so exhausted
    Sarpi's meager frame that for more than twenty days he had no strength to move or
    lift his hands. Not a word of impatience escaped his lips; and when Acquapendente
    began to medicate the worst wound in his face, he moved the dozen doctors to laughter
    by wittily observing, 'And yet the world main<span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"
    id="page211"></a>{211}</span> tains that it was given <i>Stilo Romanae Curiae</i>.'<a
    name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145"
    class="fnanchor">[145]</a> His old friend Malipiero would fain have kept the dagger
    as a relic. But Sarpi suspended it at the foot of a crucifix in the church of the
    Servi, with this appropriate inscription, <i>Dei Filio Liberatori</i>. When he had
    recovered from his long suffering, the Republic assigned their Counselor an increase
    of pension in order that he might maintain a body of armed guards, and voted him a
    house in S. Marco for the greater security of his person. But Sarpi begged to be
    allowed to remain among the friars, with whom he had spent his life, and where his
    vocation bound him. In the future he took a few obvious precautions, passing in a
    gondola to the Rialto and thence on foot through the crowded Merceria to the Ducal
    Palace, and furthermore securing the good offices of his attendants in the convent by
    liberal gifts of money. Otherwise, he refused to alter the customary tenor of his
    way.</p>
    <p>The State of Venice resented this attack upon their servant as though it had been
    directed against the majesty of the Republic. A proclamation was immediately issued,
    offering enormous rewards for the capture or murder of the criminals, especially so
    worded as to insinuate the belief that men of high position in Rome were implicated.
    The names of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id="page212"></a>{212}</span>
    the chief conspirators were as follows: Ridolfo Poma, a broken Venetian merchant;
    Alessandro Parrasio of Ancona, outlawed for the murder of his uncle; a priest,
    Michele Viti of Bergamo; and two soldiers of adventure, Giovanni di Fiorenza and
    Pasquale di Bitonto. Having escaped to the Lido, they took ship for Ravenna and
    arrived in due course at Ancona, where they drew 1000 crowns from the Papal Camera,
    and proceeded to make triumphal progress through Romagna. Their joy was dashed by
    hearing that Fra Paolo had not been killed. The Venetian <i>bando</i> filled them
    with fears and mutual suspicions, each man's hand being now set against his comrade,
    and every ruffian on the road having an interest in their capture. Yet after some
    time they continued their journey to Rome, and sought sanctuary in the palace of
    Cardinal Colonna. Here their reception was not what they had anticipated. Having
    failed in the main object and brought scandal on the Church, they were maintained for
    some months in obscurity, and then coldly bidden to depart with scanty recompense.
    All this while their lives remained exposed to the Venetian ban. Under these
    circumstances it is not strange that the men were half-maddened. Poma raged like a
    wild beast, worshiping the devil in his private chamber, planning schemes of piracy
    and fresh attacks on Sarpi, even contemplating a last conspiracy against the person
    of the Pope. He was seized in Rome by the <i>sbirri</i> of the government, and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>{213}</span> one of his sons
    perished in the scuffle. Another returned to Venice, and ended his days there as a
    vagrant lunatic. Poma himself died mad in the prison of Civit&agrave; Vecchia. Viti
    also died mad in the same prison. Parrasio died in prison at Rome. One of the
    soldiers was beheaded at Perugia, and the other fell a victim to cut-throats on the
    high road. Such was the end of the five conspirators against Fra Paolo Sarpi's
    life.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146"
    class="fnanchor">[146]</a> A priest, Franceschi, who had aided and abetted their
    plot, disappeared soon after the explosion; and we may rest tolerably assured that
    his was no natural removal to another world.</p>
    <p>It is just to add that the instigation of this murderous plot was never brought
    home by direct testimony to any members of the Papal Court. But the recourse which
    the assassins first had to the asylum of the Nuncio in Venice, their triumphal
    progress through cities of the Church, the moneys they drew on several occasions, the
    interest taken in them by Cardinal Borghese when they finally reached Rome, and their
    deaths in Papal dungeons, are circumstances of overwhelming cumulative evidence
    against the Curia. Sarpi's life was frequently attempted in the following years. On
    one occasion, Cardinal Bellarmino, more mindful of private friendship than of public
    feud, sent him warning that he must live prepared for fresh attacks from Rome.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>{214}</span> Indeed, it
    may be said that he now passed his days in continual expectation of poison or the
    dagger. This appears plainly in Fulgenzio's biography and in the pages of his private
    correspondence. The most considerable of these later conspiracies, of which Fra
    Fulgenzio gives a full account, implicated Cardinal Borghese and the General of the
    Servite Order.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> The history seems in brief to be
    as follows. One Fra Bernardo of Perugia, who had served the Cardinal during their
    student days, took up his residence in Rome so soon as Scipione Borghese became a
    profitable patron. In the course of the year 1609, this Fra Bernardo dispatched a
    fellow-citizen of his, named Fra Giovanni Francesco, to Padua, whence he frequently
    came across to Venice and tampered with Sarpi's secretary, Fra Antonio of Viterbo.
    These three friars were all of them Servites; and it appears that the General looked
    with approval on their undertaking. The upshot of the traffic was that Fra Antonio,
    having ready access to Sarpi's apartments and person, agreed either to murder him
    with a razor or to put poison in his food, or, what was finally determined on, to
    introduce a couple of assassins into his bedchamber at night. An accident revealed
    the plot, and placed a voluminous cyphered correspondence in the hands of the
    Venetian Inquisitor of State. Fra Fulgenzio significantly adds that of all the
    persons incriminated by these letters, none, with the exception of the General of the
    Ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>{215}</span> vites, was
    under the rank of Cardinal. The wording of his sentence is intentionally obscure, but
    one expression seems even to point at the Pope.<a name="FNanchor_148_148"
    id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>
    <p>At the close of this affair, so disgraceful to the Church and to his Order, Fra
    Paolo besought the Signory of Venice on his bended knees, as a return for services
    rendered by him to the State, that no public punishment should be inflicted on the
    culprits. He could not bear, he said, to be the cause of bringing a blot of infamy
    upon his religion, or of ruining the career of any man. Fra Giovanni Francesco
    afterwards redeemed his life by offering weighty evidence against his powerful
    accomplices. But what he revealed is buried in the oblivion with which the Council of
    Ten in Venice chose to cover judicial acts of State-importance.</p>
    <p>It is worth considering that in all the attempts upon Sarpi's life, priests,
    friars, and prelates of high place were the prime agents.<a name="FNanchor_149_149"
    id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Poor
    devils like Poma and Parrasio lay ready to their hands as sanguinary instruments,
    which, after work performed, could be broken if occasion served. What, then, was the
    religious reformation of which the Roman Court made ostentatious display when it
    secured its unexpected triumph in the Council of Trent?</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>{216}</span> We must
    reply that in essential points of moral conduct this reformation amounted to almost
    nothing, and in some points to considerably less than nothing. The Church of God, as
    Sarpi held, suffered deformation rather than reformation. That is to say, this
    Church, instead of being brought back to primitive simplicity and purged of temporal
    abuses, now lay at the mercy of ambitious hypocrites who with the Supreme Pontiff's
    sanction, pursued their ends by treachery and violence. Its hostility to heretics and
    its new-fangled doctrine of Papal almightiness encouraged the spread of a pernicious
    casuistry which favored assassination. Kings at strife with the Catholic Alliance,
    honest Christians defending the prerogatives of their commonwealth, erudite
    historians and jurists who disapproved of substituting Popes in Rome for God in
    heaven, might be massacred or kidnapped by ruffians red with the blood of their
    nearest relatives and carrying the condemnation of their native States upon their
    forehead. According to the post-Tridentine morality of Rome, that morality which the
    Jesuits openly preached and published, which was disseminated in every prelate's
    ante-chamber, and whispered in every parish-priest's confessional, enormous sins
    could be atoned and eternal grace be gained by the merciless and traitorous murder of
    any notable man who savored of heresy. If the Holy Office had instituted a
    prosecution against the victim and had condemned him in his absence, the path was
    plain. Sentence of excommunication <span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"
    id="page217"></a>{217}</span> and death publicly pronounced on such a man reduced him
    to the condition of a wild beast, whose head was worth solid coin and plenary
    absolution to the cut-throat. A private minute recorded on the books of the
    Inquisitors had almost equal value; and Sarpi was under the impression that some such
    underhand proceeding against himself had loosed a score of knives. But short of these
    official or semi-judicial preliminaries, it was maintained upon the best casuistical
    authority that to take the life of any suspected heretic, of any one reputed
    heterodox in Roman circles, should be esteemed a work of merit creditable to the
    miscreant who perpetrated the deed, and certain, even should he die for it, to yield
    him in the other world the joys of Paradise. These joys the Jesuits described in
    language worthy of the Koran. Dabbled in Sarpi's or Duplessis Mornay's blood,
    quartered and tortured like Ravaillac, the desperado of so pious a crime would swim
    forever in oceans of ecstatic pleasure. The priest, ambitious for his hierarchy,
    fanatical in his devotion to the Church, relying upon privilege if he should chance
    to be detected, had a plain interest in promoting and directing such conspiracies.
    Men of blood, and bandits up to the hilts in crimes of violence, rendered reckless by
    the indiscriminate cruelty of justice in those days, allured by the double hope of
    pay and spiritual benefit, rushed without a back-thought into like adventures. Ready
    to risk their lives in an unholy cause, such ruffians were doubly glad to do so when
    the bait of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>{218}</span>
    heaven's felicity was offered to their grosser understanding. These considerations
    explain, but are far indeed from exculpating, the complicity of clergy and
    cut-throats in every crime of violence attempted against foes of Papal Rome.</p>
    <p>Sarpi's worst enemies could scarcely fix on him the crime of heresy. He was a
    staunch Catholic; so profoundly versed both in dogmatic theology and in
    ecclesiastical procedure, that to remain within the straitest limits of orthodoxy,
    while opposing the presumption of the Papal Court, gave him no trouble. Yet at the
    time in which he lived, the bare act of resistance to any will or whim of Rome,
    passed with those doctors who were forging new systems of Pontifical supremacy, for
    heretical. In this arbitrary and uncanonical sense of the phrase Sarpi was
    undoubtedly a heretic. He had deserved the hatred of the Curia, the Inquisition, the
    Jesuits, and their myrmidons. Steadily, with caution and a sober spirit, he had
    employed his energies and vast accumulated stores of knowledge in piling up
    breakwaters against their pernicious innovations. In all his controversial writings
    during the interdict Sarpi used none but solid arguments, drawn from Scripture, canon
    law, and the Councils of the early Church, in order to deduce one single principle:
    namely that both secular and ecclesiastical organisms, the State and the Church, are
    divinely appointed, but with several jurisdictions and for diverse ends. He pressed
    this principle home with hammer-strokes of most con<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page219" id="page219"></a>{219}</span> vincing proof on common sense and
    reason. He did so even superfluously to our modern intellect, which is fatigued by
    following so elaborate a chain of precedents up to a foregone conclusion. But he let
    no word fall, except by way of passing irony, which could bring contempt upon
    existing ecclesiastical potentates; and he maintained a dispassionate temper, while
    dealing with topics which at that epoch inflamed the fiercest party strife. His
    antagonists, not having sound learning, reason, and the Scripture on their side, were
    driven to employ the rhetoric of personal abuse and the stiletto. In the end the
    badness of their cause was proved by the recourse they had to conspiracies of pimps,
    friars, murderers, and fanatics, in order to stifle that voice of truth which told
    them of their aberration from the laws of God.</p>
    <p>It was not merely by his polemical writings during the interdict, that Sarpi won
    the fame of heretic in ultra-papal circles. In his office as Theologian to the
    Republic he had to report upon all matters touching the relations of State to Church;
    and the treatises which he prepared on such occasions assumed the proportions, in
    many instances, of important literary works. Among these the most considerable is
    entitled <i>Delle Materie Beneficiarie</i>. Professing to be a discourse upon
    ecclesiastical benefices, it combines a brief but sufficient history of the temporal
    power of the Papacy, an inquiry into the arts whereby the Church's property <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>{220}</span> had been accumulated,
    and a critique of various devices employed by the Roman Curia to divert that wealth
    from its original objects. In 'this golden volume,' to use Gibbon's words, 'the Papal
    system is deeply studied and freely described.' Speaking of its purport, Hallam
    observes: 'That object was neither more nor less than to represent the wealth and
    power of the Church as ill-gotten and excessive.' Next in importance is a <i>Treatise
    on the Inquisition</i>, which gives a condensed sketch of the origin and development
    of the Holy Office, enlarging upon the special modifications of that institution as
    it existed in Venice. Here likewise Sarpi set himself to resist ecclesiastical
    encroachments upon the domain of secular jurisdiction. He pointed out how the right
    of inquiring into cases of heretical opinion had been gradually wrested from the
    hands of the bishop and the State, and committed to a specially-elected body which
    held itself only responsible to Rome. He showed how this powerful tribunal was being
    used to the detriment of States, by extending its operation into the sphere of
    politics, excluding the secular magistracy from participation in its judgments, and
    arrogating to itself the cognizance of civil crimes. A third <i>Discourse upon the
    Press</i> brought the same system of attack to bear upon the Index of prohibited
    books. Sarpi was here able to demonstrate that a power originally delegated to the
    bishops of proscribing works pernicious to morality and religion, was now employed
    for the suppression <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"
    id="page221"></a>{221}</span> of sound learning and enlightenment by a Congregation
    sworn to support the Papacy. Passing from their proper sphere of theology and ethics,
    these ecclesiastics condemned as heretical all writings which denied the supremacy of
    Rome over nations and commonwealths, prevented the publication and sale of books
    which defended the rights of princes and republics, and flooded Europe with doctrines
    of regicide, Pontifical omnipotence, and hierarchical predominance in secular
    affairs. These are the most important of Sarpi's minor works. But the same spirit of
    liberal resistance against Church aggression, supported by the same erudition and
    critical sagacity, is noticeable in a short tract explaining how the Right of Asylum
    had been abused to the prejudice of public justice; in a <i>Discourse upon the
    Contributions of the Clergy</i>, distinguishing their real from their assumed
    immunities; and in a brief memorandum upon the Greek College in Rome, exposing the
    mischief wrought in commonwealths and families by the Jesuit system of education.</p>
    <p>In all these writings Sarpi held firmly by his main principle, that the State, no
    less than the Church, exists <i>jure divino</i>. The papal usurpation of secular
    prerogatives was in his eyes not merely a violation of the divinely appointed order
    of government, but also a deformation of the ecclesiastical ideal. Those, he argued,
    are the real heretics who deprave the antique organism of the Church by <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span> making the Pope
    absolute, who preach the deity of the Roman Pontiff as though he were a second God
    equal in almightiness to God in heaven. 'Nay,' he exclaims in a passage marked by
    more than usual heat, 'should one drag God from heaven they would not stir a finger,
    provided the Pope preserved his vice-divinity or rather super-divinity. Bellarmino
    clearly states that to restrict the Papal authority to spiritual affairs is the same
    as to annihilate it; showing that they value the spiritual at just zero.'<a
    name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150"
    class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Sarpi saw that the ultra-papalists of his day, by
    subordinating the State, the family and the individual to the worldly interests of
    Rome, by repressing knowledge and liberty of conscience, preaching immoral and
    anti-social doctrines, encouraging superstition and emasculating education, for the
    maintenance of those same worldly interests, were advancing steadily upon the path of
    self-destruction. The essence of Christianity was neglected in this brutal struggle
    for supremacy; while truth, virtue and religion, those sacred safe-guards of
    humanity, which the Church was instituted to preserve, ran no uncertain risk of
    perishing through the unnatural perversion of its aims.</p>
    <p>The work which won for Sarpi a permanent place in the history of literature, and
    which in his lifetime did more than any other of his writings to expose the Papal
    system, is the history of the Tridentine Council. It was not published with his name
    or <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>{223}</span> with his
    sanction. A manuscript copy lent by him to Marcantonio de Dominis, Archbishop of
    Spalatro, was taken by that waverer between Catholicism and Protestantism to England,
    and published in London under the pseudonym of Pietro Soave Polano&mdash;an anagram
    of Paolo Sarpi Veneto&mdash;in the year 1619. That Sarpi was the real author admits
    of no doubt. The book bears every stamp of genuineness. It is written in the lucid,
    nervous, straightforward style of the man, who always sought for mathematical
    precision rather than rhetorical elegance in his use of language. Sarpi had taken
    special pains to collect materials for a History of the Council; and in doing so he
    had enjoyed exceptional advantages. Early in his manhood he formed at Mantua a close
    friendship with Camillo Olivo, who had been secretary to the Papal Legate, Cardinal
    Gonzaga of Mantua, at Trent. During his residence in Rome between 1585 and 1587 he
    became intimately acquainted with Cardinal Castagna, president of the committee
    appointed for drawing up the decrees of the Council. In addition to the information
    afforded by these persons, officially connected with the transactions of the Council,
    Sarpi had at his command the Archives of Venice, including the dispatches of
    ambassadors, and a vast store of published documents, not to mention numerous details
    which in the course of his long commerce with society he had obtained from the lips
    of credible witnesses. All these sources, grasped in their diversity by his powerful
    memory and animated with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"
    id="page224"></a>{224}</span> his vivid intellect, are worked into an even, plain,
    dispassionate narration, which, in spite of the dryness of the subject, forms a truly
    fascinating whole. That Sarpi was strictly fair in his conception of the Council, can
    scarcely be maintained; for he wrote in a spirit of distinct antagonism to the ends
    which it achieved. Yet the more we examine the series of events described by him, the
    more are we convinced that in its main features the work is just. When Sir Roger
    Twysden pronounced it 'to be written with so great moderation, learning and wisdom,
    as might deserve a place among the exactest pieces of ecclesiastic story any age had
    produced,' he did not overshoot the mark. Nor has the avowedly hostile investigation
    to which Cardinal Pallavicini submitted it, done more than to confirm its credit by
    showing that a deadly enemy, with all the arsenal of Roman documents at his command,
    could only detect inaccuracies in minor details and express rage at the controlling
    animus of the work.</p>
    <p>It was Sarpi's object to demonstrate that the Council of Trent, instead of being a
    free and open Synod of Christians assembled to discuss points at issue between the
    Catholic and Protestant Churches, was in reality a closely-packed conciliabulum, from
    which Protestants were excluded, and where Catholics were dominated by the Italian
    agents of the Roman Court. He made it clear, and in this he is confirmed by masses of
    collateral proofs, that the presiding spirit of the Council was human diplomacy
    rather than <span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>{225}</span>
    divine inspiration, and that Roman intrigue conducted its transactions to an issue
    favorable for Papal supremacy by carefully manipulating the interests of princes and
    the passions of individuals. 'I shall narrate the causes,' he remarks, in his
    exordium, 'and the negotiations of an ecclesiastical convocation during the course of
    twenty-two years, for divers ends and with varied means; by whom promoted and
    solicited, by whom impeded and delayed; for another eighteen years, now brought
    together, now dissolved; always held with various ends; and which received a form and
    accomplishment quite contrary to the design of those who set it going, as also to the
    fear of those who took all pains to interrupt it. A clear monition that man ought to
    yield his thoughts resignedly to God and not to trust in human prudence. Forasmuch as
    this Council, desired and put in motion by pious men for the reunion of the Church
    which had begun to break asunder, hath so established schism and embittered factions
    that it has rendered those discords irreconcilable; handled by princes for the reform
    of the ecclesiastical system, has caused the greatest deformation that hath ever been
    since the name of Christian came into existence; by bishops with hope expected as
    that which would restore the episcopal authority, now in large part absorbed by the
    sole Roman Pontiff, hath been the reason of their losing the last vestige of it and
    of their reduction to still greater servitude. On the other hand, dreaded and evaded
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>{226}</span> by the Court of
    Rome, as an efficient instrument for curbing that exorbitant power, which from small
    beginnings hath arrived by various advances to limitless excess, it has so
    established and confirmed it over the portion still left subject to it, as that it
    never was so vast nor so well-rooted.' In treating of what he pithily calls 'the
    Iliad of our age,' Sarpi promises to observe the truth, and protests that he is
    governed by no passion. This promise the historian kept faithfully. His animus is
    never allowed to transpire in any direct tirades; his irony emerges rather in
    reporting epigrams of others than in personal sarcasms or innuendoes; his own
    prepossessions and opinions are carefully veiled. After reading the whole voluminous
    history we feel that it would be as inaccurate to claim Sarpi for Protestantism as to
    maintain that he was a friend of ultra-papal Catholicism. What he really had at heart
    was the restoration of the Church of God to unity, to purer discipline and to sincere
    spirituality. This reconstruction of Christendom upon a sound basis was, as he
    perceived, rendered impossible by the Tridentine decrees. Yet, though the dearest
    hope of his heart had been thus frustrated, he set nothing down in malice, nor vented
    his own disappointment in laments which might have seemed rebellious against the
    Divine will. Sarpi's personality shows itself most clearly in the luminous discourses
    with which from time to time he elucidates obscure matters of ecclesiastical history.
    Those on episcopal residence, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"
    id="page227"></a>{227}</span> pluralism, episcopal jurisdiction, the censure of
    books, and the malappropriation of endowments, are specially valuable.<a
    name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151"
    class="fnanchor">[151]</a> If no other proof existed, these digressions would render
    Sarpi's authorship of the History unmistakable. They are identical in style and in
    intention with his acknowledged treatises, firmly but calmly expressing a sound
    scholar's disapproval of abuses which had grown up like morbid excrescences upon the
    Church. Taken in connection with the interpolated summaries of public opinion
    regarding the Council's method of procedure and its successive decrees, these
    discourses betray a spirit of hostility to Rome which is nowhere openly expressed.
    Sarpi illustrated Aretino's cynical sentence: 'How can you speak evil of your
    neighbor? By speaking the truth, by speaking the truth!'&mdash;without rancor and
    without passion. Nothing, in fact, could have been more damaging to Rome than his
    precise analysis of her arts in the Council.</p>
    <p>I have said that the History of the Tridentine Council, though it confirmed
    Sarpi's heretical reputation, would not justify us in believing him at heart a
    Protestant.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> Very much
    depends on how we define the word Protestant. If Sarpi's known opinions regarding the
    worldliness of Rome, ecclesiastical abuses, and Papal supremacy, constitute a
    Protestant, then he certainly was one. But if antagonism to Catholic dogma,
    repudiation of the Catholic Sacraments and abhorrence of monastic institutions are
    also necessary to the definition, then Sarpi was as certainly no Protestant. He seems
    to have anticipated the position of those Christians who now are known as Old
    Catholics. This appears from his vivid sympathy with the Gallican Church, and from
    his zealous defense of those prerogatives and privileges in which the Venetian Church
    resembled that of France. We must go to his collected letters in order to penetrate
    his real way of thinking on the subject of reform. The most important of these are
    addressed to Frenchmen&mdash;Ph. Duplessis Mornay, De l'Isle Groslot, Leschassier, a
    certain Roux, Gillot, and Casaubon. If we could be quite sure that the text of these
    familiar letters had not been tampered with before publication, their testimony would
    be doubly valuable. As it is, no one at all acquainted with Sarpi's style will doubt
    that in the main they are trustworthy. Here and there <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page229" id="page229"></a>{229}</span> it may be that a phrase has been
    inserted or modified to give a stronger Protestant coloring. The frequent allusion to
    the Court of Rome under the title of <i>La Meretrice</i>, especially in letters to
    Duplessis Mornay, looks suspicious.<a name="FNanchor_153_153"
    id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Yet
    Dante, Petrarch and Savonarola used similar metaphors, when describing the secular
    ambition of the Papacy. Having pointed out a weakness in this important series of
    documents, I will translate some obviously genuine passages which illustrate Sarpi's
    attitude toward reform.</p>
    <p>Writing to Leschassier upon the literary warfare of James I., he says it is a pity
    that the king did not abstain from theology and confine himself to the defense of his
    princely prerogatives against the claims of Rome. He has exposed himself to the
    imputation of wishing to upset the foundations of the faith. 'With regard to our own
    affairs [<i>i.e.</i> in Venice], we do not seek to mix up heaven and earth, things
    human and things divine. Our desire is to leave the sacraments and all that pertains
    to religion as they are, believing that we can uphold the secular government in those
    rights which Scripture and the teaching of the Fathers confirm.'<a
    name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154"
    class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In another place he says: 'I have well considered the
    reasons which drew Germany and England into changing the observances of religion; but
    upon us neither these nor others of greater weight will exercise any influence.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>{230}</span> It is better
    to suffer certain rules and customs that are not in all points commendable, than to
    acquire a taste for revolution and to yield to the temptation of confounding all
    things in chaos.'<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> His own grievance against the
    Popes, he adds, is that they are innovating and destroying the primitive constitution
    of the Church. With regard to the possibility of uniting Christendom, he writes that

    class="fnanchor">[163]</a> These give an opportunity to free religious discussion,
    and to the dissemination of Gospel truth. Sarpi is strong in his praise of Fra
    Fulgenzio for fearlessly preaching Christ and the truth, and repeats the Pope's
    complaint that the Bible is injurious to the Catholic faith.<a
    name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164"
    class="fnanchor">[164]</a> He led William Bedell, chaplain to Sir H. Wotton and
    afterwards Bishop of Kilmore, to believe that Fra Fulgenzio and himself were ripe for
    Reform. 'These two I know,' writes Bedell to Prince Henry, 'as having practiced with
    them, to desire nothing so much as the Reformation of the Church, and, in a word, for
    the substance of religion they are wholly ours.'<a name="FNanchor_165_165"
    id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
    During the interdict Diodati came from Geneva to Venice, and Sarpi informed him that
    some 12,000 persons in the city wished for rupture with Rome; but the government and
    the aristocracy being against it, nothing could be done.<a name="FNanchor_166_166"
    id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>
    <p>Enough has now been quoted to throw some light upon Sarpi's attitude toward
    Protestantism. That he most earnestly desired the overthrow of ultra-papal
    Catholicism, is apparent. So also are his sympathies with those reformed nations
    which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span> enjoyed
    liberty of conscience and independence of ecclesiastical control. Yet his first duty
    was to Venice; and since the State remained Catholic, he personally had no intention
    of quitting the communion into which he had been born and in which he was an ordained
    priest. All Churches, he wrote in one memorable letter to Casaubon, have their
    imperfections. The Church of Corinth, in the days of the Apostles, was corrupt.<a
    name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167"
    class="fnanchor">[167]</a> 'The fabric of the Church of God,' being on earth, cannot
    expect immunity from earthly frailties.<a name="FNanchor_168_168"
    id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Such
    imperfections and such frailties as the Catholic Church shared with all things of
    this world, Sarpi was willing to tolerate. The deformation of that Church by Rome and
    Jesuitry he manfully withstood; but he saw no valid reason why he should abandon her
    for Protestantism. In his own conscience he remained free to serve God in spirit and
    in truth. The mind of the man in fact was too far-seeing and too philosophical to
    exchange old lamps for new without a better prospect of attaining to absolute truth
    than the dissenters from Catholicism afforded. His interest in Protestant, as
    separate from Catholic Reform, was rather civil and political than religious or
    theological. Could those soaring wings of Rome be broken, then and not till then
    might the Italians enjoy freedom of conscience, liberty of discussion and research,
    purer piety, and a healthier activity as citizens.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page233" id="page233"></a>{233}</span></p>
    <p>Side light may be thrown upon Sarpi's judgment of the European situation by
    considering in detail what he said about the Jesuits. This company, as we have seen,
    lent its support to Papal absolutism; and during the later years of Sarpi's life it
    seemed destined to carry the world before it, by control of education, by devotion to
    Rome, by adroit manipulation of the religious consciousness for anti-social ends and
    ecclesiastical aggrandizement.</p>
    <p>The sure sign of being in the right, said Sarpi, is when one finds himself in
    contradiction to the Jesuits. They are most subtle masters in ill-doing, men who, if
    their needs demand, are ready to commit crimes worse than those of which they now are
    guilty. All falsehood and all blasphemy proceed from them. They have set the last
    hand at establishing universal corruption. They are a public plague, the plague of
    the world, chameleons who take their color from the soil they squat on, flatterers of
    princes, perverters of youth. They not only excuse but laud lying; their
    dissimulation is bare and unqualified mendacity; their malice is inestimable. They
    have the art so to blend their interests and that of Rome, seeking for themselves and
    the Papacy the empire of the world, that the Curia must needs support them, while it
    cowers before their inscrutable authority. They are the ruin of good literature and
    wholesome doctrine by their pitiful pretense of learning and their machinery of false
    teaching. On ignorance rests their power, and truth is mortal to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>{234}</span> them. Every vice of
    which humanity is capable, every frailty to which it is subject, finds from them
    support and consolation. If S. Peter had been directed by a Jesuit confessor he might
    have arrived at denying Christ without sin. The use the confessional as an instrument
    of political and domestic influence, reciprocating its confidences one with the other
    in their own debates, but menacing their penitents with penalties if a word of their
    counsel be bruited to the world. Expelled from Venice, they work more mischief there
    by their intrigues than they did when they were tolerated.<a name="FNanchor_169_169"
    id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> They
    scheme to get a hold on Constantinople and Palestine, in order to establish
    seminaries of fanatics and assassins. They are responsible for the murder of Henri
    IV., for if they did not instigate Ravaillac, their doctrine of regicide inspired
    him. They can creep into any kingdom, any institution, any household, because they
    readily accept any terms and subscribe to any conditions in the certainty that by the
    adroit use of flattery, humbug, falsehood, and corruption, they will soon become
    masters of the situation. In France they are the real Morbus Gallicus. In Italy they
    are the soul of the Diacatholicon.</p>
    <p>The torrent of Sarpi's indignation against the Jesuits, as perverters of sound
    doctrine in the Church, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"
    id="page235"></a>{235}</span> disturbers of kingdoms, sappers of morality and
    disseminators of vile customs through society, runs so violently forward that we are
    fain to check it, while acknowledging its justice. One passage only, from the many
    passages bearing on this topic in his correspondence, demands special citation, since
    it deals directly with the whole material of the present work. Writing to his friend
    Leschassier, he speaks as follows: 'Nothing can be of more mischief to you in France
    than the dishonesty of bad confessors and their determination to aggrandize Rome by
    any means, together with the mistaken zeal of the good sort. We have arrived at a
    point where cure of the disease must even be despaired of. Fifty years ago things
    went well in Italy. There was no public system of education for training young men to
    the profit of the clergy. They were brought up by their parents in private, more for
    the advantage of their families than for that of the hierarchy. In religious houses,
    where studies flourished, attention was paid to scholastic logic. The jurisdiction
    and the authority of the Pope were hardly touched on; and while theology was pursued
    at leisure, the majority passed their years in contemplation of the Deity and angels.
    Recently, through the decrees of the Tridentine Council, schools have been opened in
    every State, which are called Seminaries, where education is concentrated on the sole
    end of augmenting ecclesiastical supremacy. Furthermore, the prelates of each
    district, partly with a view of saving their own <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span> pockets, and partly that they may
    display a fashionable show of zeal, have committed the charge of those institutions
    to Jesuits. This has caused a most important alteration in the aspect of affairs.'<a
    name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170"
    class="fnanchor">[170]</a> It would be difficult to state the changes effected by the
    Tridentine Council and the commission of education to the Jesuits more precisely and
    more fairly than in this paragraph. How deeply Sarpi had penetrated the Jesuitical
    arts in education, can be further demonstrated from another passage in his minor
    works.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> In a memoir prepared for the
    Venetian Signory, he says that the Jesuits are vulgarly supposed to be unrivaled as
    trainers of youth. But a patent equivocation lurks under this phrase 'unrivaled.'
    Education must be considered with regard to the utility of the State. 'Now the
    education of the Jesuits consists in stripping the pupil of every obligation to his
    father, to his country, and to his natural prince; in diverting all his love and fear
    toward a spiritual superior, on whose nod, beck and word he is dependent. This system
    of training is useful for the supremacy of ecclesiastics and for such secular
    governments as they are ready to submit to; and none can deny that the Jesuits are
    without equals in their employment of it. Yet in so far as it is advantageous in such
    cases, so also is it prejudicial to States, the end whereof is liberty and real
    virtue, and with whom the ecclesiastical faction <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page237" id="page237"></a>{237}</span> remains in bad accord. From the Jesuit
    colleges there never issued a son obedient to his father, devoted to his country,
    loyal to his prince. The cause of this is that the Jesuits employ their best energies
    in destroying natural affection, respect for parents, reverence for princes.
    Therefore they only deserve to be admired by those whose interest it is to subject
    family, country and government to ecclesiastical interests.'</p>
    <p>The Provincial Letters of Pascal, which Sarpi anticipated in so many points,
    suffice to prove that he was justified in this hostility to ultramontanism backed up
    by Jesuit artifices. He was writing, be it remembered, at the very high tide of Papal
    domination, when Henri IV. had been assassinated, and when the overwhelming forces of
    secular interests combined with intellectual progress had not as yet set limits on
    ecclesiastical encroachment. The dread lest Europe should succumb to Rome, now proved
    by subsequent events an unsubstantial nightmare, was real enough for this Venetian
    friar, who ran daily risk of assassination in down-trodden servile Italy, with
    Spanish plots threatening the arsenal, with France delivered into the hands of
    Florentines and casuists, with England in the grip of Stuarts, and with Germany
    distracted by intrigues. He could not foresee that in the course of a century the
    Jesuits would be discredited by their own arts, and that the Papacy would subside
    into a pacific sovereignty bent on securing its own temporal existence by
    accommodation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"
    id="page238"></a>{238}</span></p>
    <p>The end of Sarpi's life consecrated the principles of duty to God and allegiance
    to his country which had animated its whole course. He fell into a bad state of
    health; yet nothing would divert him from the due discharge of public business. 'All
    the signs of the soul's speedy departure from that age-enfeebled body, were visible;
    but his indefatigable spirit sustained him in such wise that he bore exactly all his
    usual burdens. When his friends and masters bade him relax his energies, he used to
    answer: My duty is to serve and not to live; there is some one daily dying in his
    office.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> When at length the very sources
    of existence failed, and the firm brain wandered for a moment, he was once heard to
    say: 'Let us go to S. Mark, for it is late.'<a name="FNanchor_173_173"
    id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The
    very last words he uttered, frequently repeated, but scarcely intelligible, were:
    'Esto Perpetua.'<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> <i>May Venice last forever</i>!
    This was the dying prayer of the man who had consecrated his best faculties to the
    service of his country. But before he passed away into that half slumber which
    precedes death, he made confession to his accustomed spiritual father, received the
    Eucharist and Extreme Unction, and bade farewell to the superior of the Servites, in
    the following sentence: 'Go ye to rest, and I will return to God, from whom I came.'
    With these words he closed his lips in silence, crossing his hands upon his <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>{239}</span> breast and fixing his
    eyes upon a crucifix that stood before him.<a name="FNanchor_175_175"
    id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>I will return to God from whom I came.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>These words&mdash;not the last, for the last were <i>Esto perpetua</i>; but the
    last spoken in the presence of his fraternity&mdash;have a deep significance for
    those who would fain understand the soul of Sarpi. When in his lifetime he spoke of
    the Church, it was always as 'the Church of God.' When he relegated his own anxieties
    for the welfare of society to a superior power, it was not to Mary, as Jesuits
    advised, nor even to Christ, but invariably to the Providence of God. Sarpi, we have
    the right to assume, lived and died a sincere believer in the God who orders and
    disposes of the universe; and this God, identical in fact though not in form with
    Bruno's, he worshiped through such symbols of ceremony and religion as had been
    adopted by him in his youth. An intellect so clear of insight as this, knew that 'God
    is a spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page240" id="page240"></a>{240}</span> spirit and in truth.' He knew that
    'neither on this mountain nor yet in Jerusalem,' neither in Protestant communities
    nor yet in Rome was the authentic God made tangible; but that a loyal human being,
    created in God's image, could serve him and adore him with life-worship under any of
    the spiritual shapes which mortal frailty has fashioned for its needs.</p>
    <p>To penetrate the abyss of any human personality is impossible. No man truly sees
    into his living neighbor's, brother's, wife's, nay even his own soul. How futile,
    therefore, is the effort which we make to seize and sketch the vital lineaments of
    men long dead, divided from us not merely by the grave which has absorbed their
    fleshly form and deprived us of their tone of voice, but also by those differences in
    thought and feeling which separate the centuries of culture! Yet this impossible task
    lies ever before the historian. Few characters are more patently difficult to
    comprehend than that of Sarpi. Ultimately, so far as it is possible to formulate a
    view, I think he may be defined as a Christian Stoic, possessed with two main
    governing ideas, duty to God and duty to Venice. His last words were for Venice; the
    penultimate consigned his soul to God. For a mind like his, so philosophically
    tempered, so versed in all the history of the world to us-wards, the materials of
    dispute between Catholic and Protestant must have seemed but trifles. He stayed where
    he had early taken root, in his Servite convent at S. Fosca, because he there could
    dedicate his life <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"
    id="page241"></a>{241}</span> to God and Venice better than in any Protestant
    conventicle. Had Venice inclined toward rupture with Rome, had the Republic possessed
    the power to make that rupture with success, Sarpi would have hailed the event
    gladly, as introducing for Italy the prospect of spiritual freedom, purer piety, and
    the overthrow of Papal-Spanish despotism. But Venice chose to abide in the old ways,
    and her Counselor of State knew better than any one that she had not the strength to
    cope with Spain, Rome, Jesuitry and Islam single-handed. Therefore he possessed his
    soul in patience, worshiping God under forms and symbols to which he had from youth
    been used, trusting the while that sooner or later God would break those mighty wings
    of Papal domination.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Soon after 1600 it became manifest that lapse of years and ecclesiastical
    intolerance had rendered Italy nearly destitute of great men. Her famous sons were
    all either dead, murdered or exiled; reduced to silence by the scythe of time or by
    the Roman 'arguments of sword and halter.' Bruno burned, Vanini burned, Carnesecchi
    burned, Paleario burned, Bonfadio burned; Campanella banished, after a quarter of a
    century's imprisonment with torture; the leaders of free religious thought in exile,
    scattered over northern Europe. Tasso, worn out with misery and madness, rested at
    length in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>{243}</span>
    tomb on the Janiculan; Sarpi survived the stylus of the Roman Curia with calm
    inscrutability at S. Fosca; Galileo meditated with closed lips in his watch-tower
    behind Bello Sguardo. With Michelangelo in 1564, Palladio in 1580, Tintoretto in
    1594, the godlike lineage of the Renaissance artists ended; and what children of the
    sixteenth century still survived to sustain the nation's prestige, to carry on its
    glorious traditions? The list is but a poor one. Marino, Tassoni, the younger
    Buonarroti, Boccalini and Chiabrera in literature. The Bolognese Academy in painting.
    After these men expand arid wildernesses of the Sei Cento&mdash;barocco architecture,
    false taste, frivolity, grimace, affectation&mdash;Jesuitry translated into culture.
    On one bright point, indeed, the eye rests with hope and comfort. Palestrina, when he
    died in 1594, did not close but opened an age for music. His posterity, those
    composers, lutists, violists and singers, from whom the modern art of arts has drawn
    her being, down to the sweet fellowship of Pergolese, Marcello and Jomelli, of
    Guarneri, Amati and Stradivari, of Farinelli, Caffarielli and La Romanina, were as
    yet but rising dimly heralded with light of dawn upon their foreheads.</p>
    <p>In making the transition from the <i>Gerusalemme</i> to the <i>Adone</i>, from the
    last great poem of the Cinque Cento to the epic of the Sei Cento, it is indispensable
    that notice should be taken of the <i>Pastor Fido</i> and its author. Giambattista
    Guarini forms a link between Vasso and the poets of the seventeenth century.<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>{244}</span> He belonged less to
    the Renaissance, more to the culture of the age created by the Council of Trent, than
    did Tasso. His life, in many of its details similar, in others most dissimilar, to
    that of Tasso, illustrates and helps us in some measure to explain the latter. It
    must therefore form the subject of a somewhat detailed study.</p>
    <p>Guarini drew his blood on the paternal side from the illustrious humanist Guarino
    of Verona, who settled at Ferrara in the fifteenth century as tutor to Leonello
    d'Este.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> By his mother he claimed descent
    from the Florentine house of Machiavelli. Born in 1537, he was seven years older than
    Torquato Tasso, whom he survived eighteen years, not closing his long life until
    1612. He received a solid education both at Pisa and Padua, and was called at the
    early age of eighteen to profess moral philosophy in the University of Ferrara. Being
    of noble birth and inheriting a considerable patrimony, Guarini might have enjoyed a
    life of uninterrupted literary leisure, if he had chosen to forego empty honors and
    shun the idle distractions of Courts. But it was the fate of distinguished men in
    that age to plunge into those quicksands. Guarini had a character and intellect
    suited to the conduct of state affairs; and he shared the delusion prevalent among
    his contemporaries, that the petty Italian principalities could offer a field for the
    exercise of these talents. 'If our country is reduced to the sole government of a
    prince,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>{245}</span> he
    writes, 'the man who serves his prince will serve his country, a duty both natural
    and binding upon all.'<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> Accordingly, soon after his
    marriage to Taddea of the noble Bendedei family, he entered the service of Alfonso
    II. This was in 1567. Tasso, in his quality of gentleman to Cardinal d'Este, had
    already shed lustre on Ferrara through the past two years. Guarini first made Tasso's
    friendship at Padua, where both were Eterei and house-guests of Scipione Gonzaga. The
    two poets now came together in a rivalry which was not altogether amicable. The
    genius of Tasso, in the prime of youth and heyday of Court-favor, roused Guarini's
    jealousy. And yet their positions were so different that Guarini might have been well
    satisfied to pursue his own course without envy. A married and elder man, he had no
    right to compete in gallantry with the brilliant young bachelor. Destined for
    diplomacy and affairs of state, he had no cause to grudge the Court poet his laurels.
    Writing in 1595, Guarini avers that 'poetry has been my pastime, never my
    profession'; and yet he made it his business at Ferrara to rival Tasso both as a
    lyrist and as a servant of dames. Like Tasso, he suffered from the spite of Alfonso's
    secretaries, Pigna and Montecatino, who seem to have incarnated the malevolence of
    courtiers in its basest form. So far, there was a close parallel between the careers
    of the two men at Ferrara.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>{246}</span> But
    Guarini's wealth and avowed objects in life caused the duke from the first to employ
    him in a different kind of service. Alfonso sent him as ambassador to Venice, Rome,
    and Turin, giving him the rank of Cavaliere in order that he might perform his
    missions with more dignity. At Turin, where he resided for some time, Guarini
    conceived a just opinion of the growing importance of the House of Savoy. Like all
    the finest spirits of his age, Tassoni, Sarpi, Chiabrera, Marino, Testi, he became
    convinced that if Italy were to recover her independence, it could only be by the
    opposition of the Dukes of Savoy to Spain. How nearly the hopes of these men were
    being realized by Carlo Emmanuele, and how those hopes were frustrated by Roman
    intrigues and the jealousy of Italian despots, is matter of history. Yet the student
    may observe with interest that the most penetrating minds of the sixteenth century
    already discerned the power by means of which, after the lapse of nearly three
    hundred years, the emancipation of Italy has been achieved.</p>
    <p>In 1574 Guarini was sent to Poland, to congratulate Henri III. upon his election
    to that monarchy. He went a second time in the following year to conduct more
    delicate negotiations. The crown of Poland was now thrown open to candidature; and
    more than one of the Italian Princes thought seriously of competing for this honor.
    The Grand Duke of Tuscany entertained the notion and abandoned it. But Alfonso II. of
    Ferrara, who had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"
    id="page247"></a>{247}</span> fought with honor in his youth in Hungary, made it a
    serious object of ambition. Manolesso, the Venetian envoy in 1575 at Ferrara, relates
    how the duke spent laborious hours in acquiring the German language, 'which no one
    learns for pleasure, since it is most barbarous, nor quickly, but with industry and
    large expenditure of time.' He also writes: 'The duke aspires to greatness, nor is
    satisfied with his present State; and therefore he has entered into the Polish
    affair, encouraged thereto by his brother the Cardinal and by his ambassador in
    Poland.'<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>
    <p>These embassies were a serious drain upon Guarini's resources; for it appears
    certain that if he received any appointments, they were inadequate to the expenses of
    long journeys and the maintenance of a becoming state. He therefore returned to
    Ferrara, considerably burdened with debts; and this was just the time at which
    Tasso's mental derangement began to manifest itself. Between 1575 and 1579, the date
    of Tasso's imprisonment at Sant' Anna, the two men lived together at the Court.
    Guarini's rivalry induced him at this period to cultivate poetry with such success
    that, when the author of the <i>Gerusalemme</i> failed, Alfonso commanded him to take
    the vacant place of Court poet. There is an interesting letter extant from Guarini to
    his friend Cornelio Bentivoglio, describing the efforts he made to comply with the
    Duke's pleasure. 'I strove to transform myself into another man, and, like a
    play<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>{248}</span> actor, to
    reassume the character, manners and emotions of a past period. Mature in age, I
    forced myself to appear young; exchanged my melancholy for gayety: affected loves I
    did not feel; turned my wisdom into folly, and, in a word, passed from philosopher to
    poet.'<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> How ill-adapted he was to this
    masquerade existence may be gathered from another sentence in the same letter. 'I am
    already in my forty-fourth year, burdened with debts, the father of eight children,
    two of my sons old enough to be my judges, and with my daughters to marry.'</p>
    <p>At last, abandoning this uncongenial strain upon his faculties, Guarini retired in
    1582 to the villa which he had built upon his ancestral estate in the Polesine, that
    delightful rustic region between Adige and Po. Here he gave himself up to the cares
    of his family, the nursing of his dilapidated fortune, and the composition of the
    <i>Pastor Fido</i>. It is not yet the time to speak of that work, upon which
    Guarini's fame as poet rests; for the drama, though suggested by Tasso's
    <i>Aminta</i>, was not finally perfected until 1602.<a name="FNanchor_180_180"
    id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Yet
    we may pause to remark upon the circumstances under which he wrote it. A disappointed
    courtier, past the prime of manhood, feeling his true vocation to be for severe
    studies and practical affairs, he yet devoted years of leisure to the slow
    elaboration of a dramatic masterpiece which <span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"
    id="page249"></a>{249}</span> is worthy to rank with the classics of Italian
    literature. During this period his domestic lot was not a happy one. He lost his
    wife, quarreled with his elder sons, and involved himself in a series of lawsuits.<a
    name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181"
    class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Litigation seems to have been an inveterate vice of his
    maturity, and he bequeathed to his descendants a coil of legal troubles. Having
    married one of his daughters, Anna, to Count Ercole Trotti, he had the misery of
    hearing in 1596 that she had fallen an innocent victim to her husband's jealousy, and
    that his third son, Girolamo connived at her assassination. In the midst of these
    annoyances and sorrows, he maintained a grave and robust attitude, uttering none of
    those querulous lamentations which flowed so readily from Tasso's pen.</p>
    <p>Tasso had used the Pastoral Drama to idealize Courts. Guarini vented all the
    bitterness of his soul against them in his <i>Pastor Fido</i>. He also wrote from his
    retirement: 'I am at ease in the enjoyment of liberty, studies, the management of my
    household.'<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Yet in 1585, while on a visit to
    Turin, he again accepted proposals from Alfonso. He had gone there in order to
    superintend the first representation of his Pastoral, which was dedicated to the Duke
    of Savoy. Extremely averse to his old servants taking office under other princes, the
    Duke of Ferrara seems to have feared lest Guarini should <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page250" id="page250"></a>{250}</span> pass into the Court of Carlo Emmanuele.
    He therefore appointed him Secretary of State; and Guarini entered upon the post in
    the same year that Tasso issued from his prison. This reconciliation did not last
    long. Alfonso took the side of Alessandro Guarini in a lawsuit with his father; and
    the irritable poet retired in indignation to Florence. The Duke of Ferrara, however,
    was determined that he should not serve another master. At Florence, Turin, Mantua
    and Rome, his attempts to obtain firm foothold in offices of trust were invariably
    frustrated; and Coccapani, the Duke's envoy, hinted that if Guarini were not
    circumspect, 'he might suffer the same fate as Tasso.' To shut Guarini up in a
    madhouse would have been difficult. Still he might easily have been dispatched by the
    poniard; and these words throw not insignificant light upon Tasso's terror of
    assassination.</p>
    <p>The Duke Alfonso died in 1597, and Ferrara reverted to the Holy See. Upon this
    occasion, Guarini was free to follow his own inclinations. He therefore established
    himself at the Court of the Grand Duke, into whose confidence he entered upon terms
    of flattering familiarity. Ferdinando de'Medici 'fell in love with him as a man may
    with a fine woman,' says his son Alessandro in one of his apologetic writings. This,
    however, meant but little; for compliments passed freely between princes and their
    courtiers; which, when affairs of purse or honor were at stake, soon turned to
    discontent and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span>
    hatred. So it fared with Guarini at Florence. His son, Guarino, made a marriage of
    which he disapproved, but which the Grand Duke countenanced. So slight a disagreement
    snapped the ties of friendship, and the restless poet removed to the Court of Urbino.
    There the last duke of the House of Rovere, Francesco Maria II., Tasso's schoolfellow
    and patron, was spending his widowed years in gloomy Spanish pride. The mortmain of
    the Church was soon to fall upon Urbino, as it had already fallen on Ferrara. Guarini
    wrote: 'The former Court in Italy is a dead thing. One may see the shadow, but not
    the substance of it nowadays. Ours is an age of appearances, and one goes
    a-masquerading all the year.' A sad but sincere epitaph, inscribed by one who had
    gone the round of all the Courts of Italy, and had survived the grand free life of
    the Renaissance.</p>
    <p>These words close Guarini's career as courtier. He returned to Ferrara in 1604,
    and in 1605 carried the compliments of that now Pontifical city to Paul V. in Rome on
    his election to the Papacy. Upon this occasion Cardinal Bellarmino told him that he
    had inflicted as much harm on Christendom by his <i>Pastor Fido</i> as Luther and
    Calvin by their heresies. He retorted with a sarcasm which has not been transmitted
    to us, but which may probably have reflected on the pollution of Christian morals by
    the Jesuits. In 1612 Guarini died at Venice, whither he was summoned by one of his
    innumerable and interminable lawsuits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"
    id="page252"></a>{252}</span></p>
    <p>Bellarmino's censure of the <i>Pastor Fido</i> strikes a modern reader as
    inexplicably severe. Yet it is certain that the dissolute seventeenth century
    recognized this drama as one of the most potent agents of corruption. Not infrequent
    references in the literature of that age to the ruin of families and reputations by
    its means, warn us to remember how difficult it is to estimate the ethical
    sensibilities of society in periods remote from our own.<a name="FNanchor_183_183"
    id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> In
    the course of the analysis which I now propose to make of this play, I shall attempt
    to show how, coming midway between Tasso's <i>Aminta</i> and Marino's <i>Adone</i>,
    and appealing to the dominant musical enthusiasms of the epoch, Guarini's <i>Pastor
    Fido</i> may have merited the condemnation of far-sighted moralists. Not censurable
    in itself, it was so related to the sentimental sensuality of its period as to form a
    link in the chain of enervation which weighed on Italy.</p>
    <p>The <i>Pastor Fido</i> is a tragi-comedy, as its author points out with some
    elaboration in the critical essay he composed upon that species of the drama. The
    scene is laid in Arcadia, where according to Guarini it was customary to sacrifice a
    maiden each year to Diana, in expiation of an ancient curse brought upon the country
    by a woman's infidelity. An oracle has declared that when two scions of divine
    lineage are united in marriage, and a faithful shepherd atones <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>{253}</span> for woman's
    faithlessness, this inhuman rite shall cease. The only youth and girl who fulfill
    these conditions of divine descent are the daughter of Titiro named Amarilli, and
    Silvio, the son of the high priest Montano. They have accordingly been betrothed. But
    Silvio is indifferent to womankind in general, and Amarilli loves a handsome
    stranger, Mirtillo, supposed to be the son of Carino. The plot turns upon the
    unexpected fulfillment of the prophecy, in spite of the human means which have been
    blindly taken to secure its accomplishment. Amarilli is condemned to death for
    suspected misconduct with a lover; and Mirtillo, who has substituted himself as
    victim in her place, is found to be the lost son of Montano. This solution of the
    intrigue, effected by an anagnorisis like that of the <i>Oedipus Tyrannus</i>,
    supplies a series of dramatic scenes and thrilling situations in the last act.
    Meanwhile the passion of Dorinda for Silvio, and the accident whereby he is brought
    to return her affection at the moment when his dart has wounded her, form a
    picturesque underplot of considerable interest. Both plot and underplot are so
    connected in the main action and so interwoven by links of mutual dependency that
    they form one richly varied fabric. Regarded as a piece of cunning mechanism, the
    complicated structure of the <i>Pastor Fido</i> leaves nothing to be desired. In its
    kind, this pastoral drama is a monumental work of art, glittering and faultless like
    a polished bas-relief of hard Corinthian <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"
    id="page254"></a>{254}</span> bronze. Each motive has been carefully prepared, each
    situation amply and logically developed. The characters are firmly traced, and
    sustained with consistency. The cold and eager hunter Silvio contrasts with tender
    and romantic Mirtillo. Corisca's meretricious arts and systematized profligacy
    enhance the pure affection of Amarilli. Dorinda presents another type of love, so
    impulsive that it conquers maidenly modesty. The Satyr is a creature of rude lust,
    foiled in its brutal appetite by the courtesan Corisca's wiliness. Carino brings the
    corruption of towns into comparison with the innocence of the country.</p>
    <p>In Carino the poet painted his own experience; and here his satire upon the Court
    of Ferrara is none the less biting because it takes the form of well-weighed and
    gravely-measured censure, instead of vehement invective. The following lines may
    serve as a specimen of Guarini's style in this species:&mdash;</p>

    </div>
    <p>The <i>Pastor Fido</i> was written in open emulation of Tasso's <i>Aminta</i>, and
    many of its most brilliant passages are borrowed from that play. Such, for example,
    is the Chorus on the Golden Age which closes the fourth act. Such, too, is the long
    description by Mirtillo of the kiss he stole from Amarilli (act ii. sc. 1). The
    motive here is taken from <i>Rinaldo</i> (canto v.), and the spirit from
    <i>Aminta</i> (act i. sc. 2). Guarini's Satyr is a studied picture from the sketch in
    Tasso's pastoral. The dialogue between Silvio and Linco (act i. sc. 1) with its
    lyrical refrain:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Lascia, lascia le selve,<br />
        </span> <span>Folle garzon, lascia le fere, ed ama:<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>reproduces the dialogue between Silvia and Dafne (act i. sc. 1) with its similar
    refrain:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>{256}</span></p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Cangia, cangia consiglio,<br />
        </span> <span>Pazzarella che sei.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In all these instances Guarini works up Tasso's motives into more elaborate forms.
    He expands the simple suggestions of his model; and employs the artifices of rhetoric
    where Tasso yielded to inspiration. One example will suffice to contrast the methods
    of the spontaneous and the reflective poet. Tasso with divine impulse had
    exclaimed:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Odi quell'usignuolo,<br />
        </span> <span>Che va di ramo in ramo<br />
        </span> <span>Cantando: Io amo, io amo!<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This, in Guarini's hands, becomes:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Quell'augellin, che canta<br />
        </span> <span>Si dolcemente, e lascivetto vola<br />
        </span> <span>Or dall'abete al faggio,<br />
        </span> <span>Ed or dal faggio al mirto,<br />
        </span> <span>S'avesse umano spirto,<br />
        </span> <span>Direbbe: Ardo d'amore, ardo d'amore.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Here a laborious effort of the constructive fancy has been substituted for a
    single flash of sympathetic imagination. Tasso does not doubt that the nightingale is
    pouring out her love in song. Guarini says that if the bird had human soul, it would
    exclaim, <i>Ardo d'amore</i>. Tasso sees it flying from branch to branch. Guarini
    teases our sense of mental vision by particularizing pine and beech and myrtle. The
    same is true of Linco's speech in general when compared with Dafne's on the ruling
    power of love in earth and heaven.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>{257}</span> Of
    imagination in the true sense of the term Guarini had none. Of fancy, dwelling
    gracefully, ingeniously, suggestively, upon externals he had plenty. The minute care
    with which he worked out each vein of thought and spun each thread of sentiment, was
    that of the rhetorician rather than the poet. Tasso had made Aminta say:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>La semplicetta Silvia<br />
        </span> <span>Pietosa del mio male,<br />

        </span> <span>Alla finta ferita, ahi lassole fece<br />
        </span> <span>Pi&ugrave; cupa, e pi&ugrave; mortale<br />

        </span> <span>Da quelle fresche rose.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Now listen to Guarini's Mirtillo:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Amor si stava, Ergasto,<br />
        </span> <span>Com'ape suol, nelle due fresche rose<br />

        </span> <span>Al baciar della mia<br />
        </span> <span>Immobile e ristretta,<br />

        </span> <span>Ma poich&egrave; mi s'offerse anch'ella, e porse<br />
        </span> <span>L'una e l'altra dolcissima sua rosa....<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This is enough to illustrate Guarini's laborious method of adding touch to touch
    without augmenting th force of the picture.<a name="FNanchor_184_184"
    id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> We
    find already here the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"
    id="page258"></a>{258}</span> transition from Tasso's measured art to the fantastic
    prolixity of Marino. And though Guarini was upon the whole chaste in use of language,
    his rhetorical love of amplification and fanciful refinement not unfrequently
    betrayed him into Marinistic conceits. Dorinda, for instance, thus addresses Silvio
    (act iv. sc. 9):</p>
    <div class="poem">

    </div>
    <p>From this to the style of the <i>Adone</i> there was only one step to be
    taken.</p>
    <p>Though the scene of the <i>Pastor Fido</i> was laid in Arcadia, the play really
    represented polite Italian society. In the softness of its sentiment, its voluptuous
    verbal melody, and its reiterated descant upon effeminate love-pleasure, it
    corresponded exactly to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page259"
    id="page259"></a>{259}</span> the spirit of its age.<a name="FNanchor_185_185"
    id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> This
    was the secret of its success; and this explains its seduction. Not Corisca's wanton
    blandishments and professed cynicism, but Mirtillo's rapturous dithyrambs on kissing,
    Dorinda's melting moods of tenderness, and Amarilli's delicate regrets that love must
    be postponed to honor, justified Bellarmino's censure. Without anywhere transgressing
    the limits of decorum, the <i>Pastor Fido</i> is steeped in sensuousness. The
    sentiment of love idealized in Mirtillo and Amarilli is pure and self-sacrificing.
    <i>Ama l'onesta mia, s'amante sei</i>, says this maiden to her lover; and he obeys
    her. Yet, though the drama is dedicated to virtue, no one can read it without
    perceiving the blandishments of its luxurious rhetoric. The sensual refinement proper
    to an age of social decadence found in it exact expression, and it became the code of
    gallantry for the next two centuries.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile the literary dictator of the seventeenth century was undoubtedly Marino.
    On him devolved the scepter which Petrarch bequeathed to Politian,<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>{260}</span> Politian to Bembo,
    and Bembo to Torquato Tasso. In natural gifts he was no unworthy successor of these
    poets, though the gifts he shared with them were conspicuously employed by him for
    purposes below the scope of any of his predecessors. In artistic achievement he
    concentrated the less admirable qualities of all, and brought the Italian poetry of
    the Renaissance to a close by exaggerating its previous defects. Yet, as a man,
    Marino is interesting, more interesting in many respects than the melancholy
    discontented Tasso. He accepted the conditions of his age with genial and careless
    sympathy, making himself at once its idol, its interpreter, and its buffoon. Finally,
    he illustrates the law of change which transferred to Neapolitans in this age the
    scepter which had formerly been swayed by Tuscans and Lombards.<a

    <p>Giovanni Battista Marino was born at Naples in 1569. His father, a jurist of
    eminence, bred him for the law. But the attractions of poetry and pleasure were
    irresistible by this mobile son of the warm South&mdash;</p>

    <p>Such, in the poet's maturity, was his judgment upon law; and probably he expressed
    the same opinion with frankness in his youth. Seeing these dispositions in his son,
    the severe parent cast him out of doors, and young Marino was free to indulge
    vagabond instincts with lazzaroni and loose companions on the quays and strands of
    Naples. In that luxurious climate a healthy native, full of youth and vigor, needs
    but little to support existence. Marino set his wits to work, and reaped too facile
    laurels in the fields of Venus and the Muses. His verses speedily attracted the
    notice of noble patrons, among whom the Duke of Bovino, the Prince of Conca, and
    Tasso's friend the Marquis Manso have to be commemorated. They took care that so
    genuine and genial a poet should not starve. It was in one of Manso's palaces that
    Marino had an opportunity of worshiping the singer of Armida and Erminia at a
    distance. He had already acquired dubious celebrity as a juvenile Don Juan and a
    writer of audaciously licentious lyrics, when disaster overtook him. He assisted one
    of his profligate friends in the abduction of a girl. For this breach of the law both
    were thrown together into prison, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"
    id="page262"></a>{262}</span> and Marino only escaped justice by the sudden death of
    his accomplice. His patrons now thought it desirable that he should leave Naples for
    a time. Accordingly they sent him with letters of recommendation to Rome, where he
    was well received by members of the Crescenzio and Aldobrandino families. The
    Cardinal Pietro Aldobrandino made him private secretary, and took him on a journey to
    Ravenna and Turin. From the commencement to the end of his literary career Marino's
    march through life was one triumphal progress. At Turin, as formerly in Naples and
    Rome, he achieved a notable success. The Duke of Savoy, Carlo Emmanuele, offered him
    a place at Court, appointed him secretary, and dubbed him Knight of S. Maurice.</p>

    <p>It was the custom of all poets in that age to live in Courts and to abuse them, to
    adulate princes and to vilify these patrons. Marino, however, had real cause to
    complain of the treachery of courtiers. He appears to have been a man of easy-going
    temper, popular among acquaintances, and serviceable to the society he frequented.
    This comradely disposition <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"
    id="page263"></a>{263}</span> did not save him, however, from jealousies and hatreds;
    for he had, besides, a Neapolitan's inclination for satire. There was a Genoese
    poetaster named Gasparo Murtola established in Court-service at Turin, who had
    recently composed a lumbering poem, <i>Il Mondo Creato</i>. Marino made fun of it in
    a sonnet; Murtola retorted; and a warfare of invectives began which equaled for
    scurrility and filth the duels of Poggio and Valla. Murtola, seeing that he was
    likely to be worsted by his livelier antagonist, waited for him one day round a
    corner, gun in hand. The gun was discharged, and wounded, not Marino, but a favorite
    servant of the duke. For this offense the assassin was condemned to death; and would
    apparently have been executed, but for Marino's generosity. He procured his enemy's
    pardon, and was repaid with the blackest ingratitude. On his release from prison
    Murtola laid hands upon a satire, <i>La Cuccagna</i>, written some time previously by
    his rival. This he laid before the duke, as a seditious attack upon the government of
    Savoy. Marino now in his turn was imprisoned; but he proved, through the intervention
    of Manso, that the <i>Cuccagna</i> had been published long before his arrival at
    Turin. Disgusted by these incidents, he next accepted an invitation from the French
    Court, and journeyed to Paris in 1615, where the Italianated society of that city
    received him like a living Phoebus. Maria de Medici, as Regent, with Concini for her
    counselor and lover, was then in all her vulgar glory.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span> Richelieu's star had not arisen to
    eclipse Italian intrigue and to form French taste by the Academy. D'Urf&egrave; and
    Du Bartas, more marinistic than Marino, more euphuistic than Euphues, gave laws to
    literature; and the pageant pictures by Rubens, which still adorn the Gallery of the
    Louvre, marked the full-blown and sensuous splendor of Maria's equipage. Marino's
    genius corresponded nicely to the environment in which he now found himself; the
    Italians of the French Court discerned in him the poet who could best express their
    ideal of existence. He was idolized, glutted with gold, indulged and flattered to the
    top of his bent. Yearly appointments estimated at 10,000 crowns were augmented by
    presents in return for complimentary verses or for copies of the poem he was then
    composing. This poem was the <i>Adone</i>, the theme of which had been suggested by
    Carlo Emmanuele, and which he now adroitly used as a means of flattering the French
    throne. First printed at Paris in 1623, its reception both there and in Italy secured
    apotheosis in his lifetime for the poet.<a name="FNanchor_187_187"
    id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> One
    minor point in this magnificent first folio edition of <i>Adone</i> deserves notice,
    as not uncharacteristic of the age. Only two Cantos out of the twenty are
    distinguished by anything peculiar in their engraved decorations. Of these two, the
    eleventh displays the shield of France; the thirteenth, which describes Falsirena's
    incantations and enchantments, is orna<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"
    id="page265"></a>{265}</span> mented with the symbol of the Jesuits, IHS. For this
    the publishers alone were probably responsible. Yet it may stand as a parable of
    all-pervasive Jesuitry. Even among the roses and raptures of the most voluptuous poem
    of the century their presence makes itself felt, as though to hint that the
    <i>Adone</i> is capable of being used according to Jesuitical rules of casuistry
    A.M.D.G. One warning voice was raised before the publication of this epic. Cardinal
    Bentivoglio wrote from Italy beseeching Marino to 'purge it of lasciviousness in such
    wise that it may not have to dread the lash of our Italian censure.' Whether he
    followed this advice, in other words whether the original MS. of the <i>Adone</i> was
    more openly licentious than the published poem, I do not know. Anyhow, it was put
    upon the Index in 1627. This does not, however, appear to have impaired its
    popularity, or to have injured its author's reputation. Soon after the appearance of
    <i>Adone</i>, Marino, then past fifty, returned to Naples. He was desirous of
    reposing on his laurels, wealthy, honored, and adored, among the scenes from which he
    fled in danger and disgrace thirty years before. His entrance into Naples was an
    ovation. The Iazzaroni came to meet his coach, dancing and scattering roses; noblemen
    attended him on horse-back; ladies gazed on him from balconies. A banner waving to
    the wind announced the advent of 'that ocean of incomparable learning, soul of lyres,
    subject for pens, material for ink, most eloquent, most fertile, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>{266}</span> phoenix of felicity,
    ornament of the laurel, of swans in their divine leisure chief and uncontested
    leader.' At Naples he died in 1625&mdash;felicitous in not having survived the fame
    which attended him through life and reached its climax just before his death.</p>
    <p>The <i>Adone</i> strikes us at first sight as the supreme poem of epicene
    voluptuousness. Its smooth-chinned hero, beautiful as a girl, soft as a girl,
    sentimental as a girl, with nothing of the man about him&mdash;except that 'Nature,
    as she wrought him, fell adoting,'&mdash;threads a labyrinth of suggestive
    adventures, in each of which he is more the patient than the agent of desire. Mercury
    introduces him to our attention in a series of those fables (tales of Narcissus,
    Ganymede, Cyparissus, Hylas, Atys) by which antiquity figured the seductiveness of
    adolescence. Venus woos him, and Falserina tries to force him. Captured in feminine
    attire by brigands, he is detained in a cave as the mistress of their chief, and
    doted on by the effeminate companion of his prison. Finally, he contends for the
    throne of Cyprus with a band of luxurious youths&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Bardassonacci, paggi da taverna.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The crown is destined for the physically fairest. The rival charms of the
    competitors are minutely noted, their personal blemishes sagaciously detected, by a
    council of pleasure-sated worldlings. In his death Adonis succumbs to the assault of
    a boar, fatally inflamed with lust, who wounds the young <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page267" id="page267"></a>{267}</span> man in his groin, dealing destruction
    where the beast meant only amorous caresses. Gods and godesses console Venus in her
    sorrow for his loss, each of whom relates the tale of similar disasters. Among these
    legends Apollo's love for Hyacinth and Phoebus' love for Pampinus figure
    conspicuously. Thus Marino's Adonis excites unhealthy interest by the spectacle of
    boyhood exposed to the caprices and allurements of both sexes doting on unfledged
    virility.</p>
    <p>What contributes to this effect, in the central motive of the poem, is that Venus
    herself is no artless virgin, no innocent Chloe, corresponding to a rustic Daphnis.
    She is already wife, mother, adulteress, <i>femme entretenue</i>, before she meets
    the lad. Her method of treating him is that of a licentious queen, who, after
    seducing page or groom, keeps the instrument of her pleasures in seclusion for
    occasional indulgence during intervals of public business. Vulcan and Mars, her
    husband and her <i>cicisbeo</i>, contest the woman's right to this caprice; and when
    the god of war compels, she yields him the crapulous fruition of her charms before
    the eye of her disconsolate boy-paramour. Her pre-occupation with Court affairs in
    Cythera&mdash;balls, pageants, sacrifices, and a people's homage&mdash;brings about
    the catastrophe. Through her temporary neglect, Adonis falls victim to a conspiracy
    of the gods. Thus the part which the female plays in this amorous epic is that of an
    accomplished courtesan, highly placed in society.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page268" id="page268"></a>{268}</span> All the pathos, all the attraction of
    beauty and of sentiment, is reserved for the adolescent male.</p>
    <p>This fact, though disagreeable, has to be noted. It is too characteristic of the
    wave of feeling at that time passing over Europe, to be ignored. The morbid strain
    which touched the Courts alike of Valois, Medici and Stuarts; which infected the
    poetry of Marlowe and of Shakespeare; which cast a sickly pallor even over sainthood
    and over painting in the school of Bologna, cannot be neglected. In Marino's
    <i>Adone</i> it reaches its artistic climax.<a name="FNanchor_188_188"
    id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>
    <p>This, however, is not the main point about the poem. The <i>Adone</i> should
    rather be classed as the epic of voluptuousness in all its forms and species. If the
    love-poetry of the Italian Renaissance began with the sensuality of Boccaccio's
    <i>Amoroso Visione</i>, it ended, after traversing the idyl, the novel, the pastoral,
    the elegy and the romance, in the more complex sensuality of Marino's <i>Adone</i>;
    for this, like the <i>Amoroso Visione</i>, but far more emphatically, proclaims the
    beatification of man by sexual pleasure:&mdash;</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Tramortiscon di gioia ebbre e languenti<br />
        </span> <span>L'anime stanche, al ciel d'Amor rapite.<br />

        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Thus voluptuousness has its transcendentalism; and Marino finds even his prolific
    vocabulary inadequate to express the mysteries of this heaven of sensuous delights.<a
    name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189"
    class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>
    <p>It must not be thought that the <i>Adone</i> is an obscene poem. Marino was too
    skillful a master in the craft of pleasure to revolt or to regale his readers with
    grossness. He had too much of the Neapolitan's frank self-abandonment to nature for
    broad indecency in art to afford him special satisfaction; and the taste of his age
    demanded innuendo. The laureate of Courts and cities saturated with licentiousness
    knew well that Coan vestments are more provocative than nudity. It was his object to
    flatter the senses and seduce the understanding rather than to stimulate coarse
    appetite. Refinement was the aphrodisiac of a sated society, and millinery formed a
    main ingredient in its love-philters.<a name="FNanchor_190_190"
    id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
    Marino, therefore, took the carnal instincts for granted, and played upon them as a
    lutist plays the strings of some lax thrilling instrument. Of moral judg<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> ment, of antipathy to
    this or that form of lust, of prejudice or preference in the material of pleasure,
    there is no trace. He shows himself equally indulgent to the passion of Mirra for her
    father, of Jove for Ganymede, of Bacchus for Pampinus, of Venus for Adonis, of Apollo
    for Hyacinth. He tells the disgusting story of Cinisca with the same fluent ease as
    the lovely tale of Psyche; passes with the same light touch over Falserina at the
    bedside of Adonis and Feronia in his dungeon; uses the same palette for the picture
    of Venus caressing Mars and the struggles of the nymph and satyr. All he demanded was
    a basis of soft sensuality, from which, as from putrescent soil, might spring the
    pale and scented flower of artful luxury.</p>
    <p>In harmony with the spirit of an age reformed or deformed by the Catholic Revival,
    Marino parades cynical hypocrisy. The eighth canto of <i>Adone</i> is an
    elaborately-wrought initiation into the mysteries of carnal pleasure. It is a hymn to
    the sense of touch:<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>{271}</span> We are led
    by subtle gradations, by labyrinthine delays, to the final beatification of Adonis.
    Picture is interwoven with picture, each in turn contributing to the panorama of
    sensual Paradise. Yet while straining all the resources of his art, with intense
    sympathy, to seduce his reader, the poet drops of set purpose phrases like the
    following:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Flora non so, non so se Frine o Taide<br />
        </span> <span>Trovar mai seppe oscenita si laide.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Here the ape masked in the man turns around and grins, gibbering vulgar words to
    point his meaning, and casting dirt on his pretended decency. While racking the
    resources of allusive diction to veil and to suggest an immodest movement of his hero
    (Adonis being goaded beyond the bounds of boyish delicacy by lascivious sights), he
    suddenly subsides with a knavish titter into prose:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Cos&igrave; il fanciullo all'inonesto gioco.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>But the end of all this practice is that innocent Adonis has been conducted by
    slow and artfully contrived approaches to a wanton's embrace, and that the spectators
    of his seduction have become, as it were, parties to his fall. To make Marino's
    cynicism of hypocrisy more glaring, he prefaces each canto with an allegory,
    declaring that Adonis and Venus symbolize the human soul abandoned to vice, and the
    allurements of sensuality which work its ruin. In the poem itself, meanwhile, the
    hero and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id="page272"></a>{272}</span>
    heroine are consistently treated as a pair of enviable, devoted, and at last
    unfortunate lovers.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>
    <p>It is characteristic of the mood expressed in the <i>Adone</i> that voluptuousness
    should not be passionate, but sentimental. Instead of fire, the poet gives us honeyed
    tears to drink, and rocks the soul upon an ever-rippling tide of Lydian melody. The
    acme of pleasure, as conceived by him, is kissing. Twenty-three of the most inspired
    stanzas of the eighth canto are allotted to a panegyric of the kiss, in which delight
    all other amorous delights are drowned.<a name="FNanchor_193_193"
    id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
    Tasso's melancholy yearning after forbidden fruit is now replaced by satiety
    contemplating the image of past joys with purring satisfaction. This quality of
    self-contented sentiment partly explains why the type of beauty adored is neither
    womanly nor manly, but adolescent. It has to be tender, fragile, solicitous, unripe;
    appealing to sensibility, not to passion, by feminine charms in nerveless and
    soulless boyhood. The most distinctive mark of Adonis is that he has no character, no
    will, no intellect. He is all sentiment, sighs, tears, pliability, and sweetness.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>{273}</span> This
    emasculate nature displays itself with consummate effect in the sobbing farewell,
    followed by the pretty pettishnesses, of the seventeenth canto.</p>
    <p>As a contrast to his over-sweet and cloying ideal of lascivious grace, Marino
    counterposes extravagant forms of ugliness. He loves to describe the loathsome
    incantations of witches. He shows Falserina prowling among corpses on a battle-field,
    and injecting the congealed veins of her resuscitated victim with abominable juices.
    He crowds the Cave of Jealousy with monsters horrible to sight and sense; depicts the
    brutality of brigands; paints hideous portraits of eunuchs, deformed hags, unnameable
    abortions. He gloats over cruelty, and revels in violence.<a name="FNanchor_194_194"

    emblem of pride, outdoes the hyperboles of Rodomonte and the lunes of Tamburlaine.
    Nowhere, either in his voluptuousness or in its counterpart of disgust, is there
    moderation. The Hellenic precept, 'Nothing overmuch,' the gracious Greek virtue of
    temperate restraint, which is for art what training is for athletes, discipline for
    soldiers, and pruning for orchard trees, has been violated in every canto, each
    phrase, the slightest motive of this poem. Sensuality can bear such violation better
    than sublimity; therefore the perfume of voluptuousness in the <i>Adone</i>, though
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>{274}</span> excessive, is
    both penetrating and profound; while those passages which aim at inspiring terror or
    dilating the imagination, fail totally of their effect. The ghastly, grotesque,
    repulsive images are so overcharged that they cease even to offend. We find ourselves
    in a region where tact, sense of proportion, moral judgment, and right adjustment of
    means to ends, have been wantonly abandoned. Marino avowed that he only aimed at
    surprising his readers:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>&Egrave; del poeta il fin la meraviglia.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>But 45,000 lines of sustained astonishment, of industrious and indefatigable
    appeals to wonder by devices of language, devices of incident, devices of
    rhodomontade, devices of innuendo, devices of <i>capricci</i> and <i>concetti</i>,
    induce the stolidity of callousness. We leave off marveling, and yield what is left
    of our sensibility to the fascination of inexhaustible picturesqueness. For, with all
    his faults, Marino was a master of the picturesque, and did possess an art of
    fascination. The picturesque, so difficult to define, so different from the pictorial
    and the poetical, was a quality of the seventeenth century corresponding to its
    defects of bad taste. And this gift no poet shared in larger measure than Marino.</p>
    <p>Granted his own conditions, granted the emptiness of moral and intellectual
    substance in the man and in his age, we are compelled to acknowledge <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span> that his literary
    powers were rich and various. Few writers, at the same time, illustrate the vices of
    decadence more luminously than this Protean poet of vacuity. Few display more clearly
    the 'expense of spirit in a waste of shame.' None teach the dependence of art upon
    moralized and humane motives more significantly than this drunken Helot of genius.
    His indifference to truth, his defiance of sobriety, his conviction that the sole end
    of art is astonishment, have doomed him to oblivion not wholly merited. The critic,
    whose duty forces him to read through the <i>Adone</i>, will be left bewildered by
    the spectacle of such profuse wealth so wantonly squandered.<a
    name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195"
    class="fnanchor">[195]</a> In spite of fatigue, in spite of disgust, he will probably
    be constrained to record his opinion that, while Tasso represented the last effort of
    noble poetry struggling after modern expression under out-worn forms of the Classical
    Revival, it was left for Marino in his levity and license to evoke a real and novel
    though <i>rococo</i> form, which nicely corresponded <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page276" id="page276"></a>{276}</span> to the temper of his times, and
    determined the immediate future of art. For this reason he requires the attention
    which has here been paid him.</p>
    <p>But how, it may be asked, was it possible to expand the story of Venus and Adonis
    into an epic of 45,000 lines? The answer to this question could best be given by an
    analysis of the twenty cantos: and since few living students have perused them, such
    a display of erudition would be pardonable. Marini does not, however, deserve so many
    pages in a work devoted to the close of the Italian Renaissance. It will suffice to
    say that the slender narrative of the amour of Venus and her boyish idol, his
    coronation as king of Cyprus, and his death by the boar's tusk, is ingeniously
    interwoven with a great variety of episodes. The poet finds occasion to relate the
    principal myths of Hellenic passion treating these in a style which frequently
    reminds us of Ovid's Metamorphoses; he borrows tales from Apuleius, Lucian, and the
    pastoral novelists; he develops the theme of jealousy in Mars and Vulcan, introduces
    his own autobiography, digresses into romantic adventures by sea and land, creates a
    rival to Venus in the sorceress Falserina, sketches the progress of poetry in one
    canto and devotes another to a panegyric of Italian princes, extols the House of
    France and adulates Marie de Medicis, surveys the science of the century, describes
    fantastic palaces and magic gardens, enters with curious minuteness into the several
    delights of the five senses, dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"
    id="page277"></a>{277}</span> courses upon Courts, ambition, avarice and honor,
    journeys over the Mediterranean, conducts a game of chess through fifty brilliant
    stanzas; in brief, while keeping his main theme in view, is careful to excite and
    sustain the attention of his readers by a succession of varied and ingeniously
    suggested novelties. Prolixity, indefatigable straining after sensational effect,
    interminable description, are the defects of the <i>Adone</i>; but they are defects
    related to great qualities possessed by the author, to inexhaustible resources,
    curious knowledge, the improvisatore's facility, the trained rhetorician's dexterity
    in the use of language, the artist's fervid delight in the exercise of his craft.</p>
    <p>Allowing for Marino's peculiar method, his <i>Adone</i> has the excellence of
    unity which was so highly prized by the poets of his age and nation. Critics have
    maintained that the whole epic is but a development of the episode of Rinaldo in
    Armida's garden. But it is more than this. It contains all the main ingredients of
    the Italian Romance, with the exception of chivalry and war. There is a pastoral
    episode corresponding to that of Erminia among the shepherds, a magnificent
    enchantress in the manner of Alcina, an imprisonment of the hero which reminds us of
    Ruggiero in Atlante's magic castle, a journey like Astolfo's to the moon, a conflict
    between good and evil supernatural powers, a thread of allegory more or less
    apparent, a side glance at contemporary history; and these elements <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>{278}</span> are so combined as to
    render the <i>Adone</i> one of the many poems in the long romantic tradition. It
    differs mainly from its predecessors in the strict unity of subject, which
    subordinates each episode and each digression to the personal adventures of the
    heroine and hero; while the death and obsequies of Adonis afford a tragic close that
    is lacking to previous poems detached from the Carolingian cycle. Contemporary
    writers praised it as a poem of peace. But it is the poem of ignoble peace, of such
    peace as Italy enjoyed in servitude, when a nation of <i>cicisbei</i> had naught to
    occupy their energies but sensual pleasure. Ingenious as Marino truly was in
    conducting his romance upon so vast a scheme through all its windings to one issue,
    we feel that the slender tale of a boy's passion for the queen of courtesans and his
    metamorphosis into the scarlet windflower of the forest supplied no worthy motive for
    this intricate machinery. The metaphor of an alum basket crystallized upon a petty
    frame of wire occurs to us when we contemplate its glittering ornaments, and reflect
    upon the poverty of the sustaining theme. It might in fact stand for a symbol of the
    intellectual vacancy of the age which welcomed it with rapture, and of the society
    which formed a century of taste upon its pattern.</p>
    <p>In another and higher literary quality the <i>Adone</i> represents that moment of
    Italian development. A foreigner may hardly pass magisterial judgment on its diction.
    Yet I venture to remark that Marino <span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"
    id="page279"></a>{279}</span> only at rare intervals attains to purity of poetic
    style; even his best passages are deformed, not merely by conceits to which the name
    of <i>Marinism</i> has been given, but also by gross vulgarities and lapses into
    trivial prose. Notwithstanding this want of distinction, however, he has a melody
    that never fails. The undulating, evenly on-flowing <i>cantilena</i> of his verbal
    music sustains the reader on a tide of song. That element of poetry, which, as I have
    observed, was developed with remarkable success by Tasso in some parts of the
    <i>Gerusalemme</i> is the main strength of the <i>Adone</i>. With Marino the <i>Chant
    d'Amour</i> never rises so high, thrills so subtly, touches the soul so sweetly and
    so sadly, as it does in Tasso's verse. But in all those five thousand octave stanzas
    it is rarely altogether absent. The singing faculty of the Neapolitan was given to
    this poet of voluptuousness; and if the song is neither deep nor stirring, neither
    stately nor sublime, it is because his soul held nothing in its vast vacuity but
    sensuous joy.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> A musical Casanova, an
    unmalignant Aretino, he sang as vulgar nature prompted; but he always kept on
    singing. His partiality for detonating dissonances, squibs and crackers of
    pyrotechnical rhetoric, braying trumpets and exploding popguns, which deafen and
    distract our ears attuned to the suave cadence of the <i>cantilena</i>, is no less
    characteristic of the Neapolitan. Marino had the impro<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page280" id="page280"></a>{280}</span> visatory exuberance, the impudence, the
    superficial passion, the luxurious delight in life, and the noisiness of his
    birthplace. He also shared its love of the grotesque as complement and contrast to
    pervading beauty.</p>
    <p>A serious fault to be found with Marino's style is its involved exaggeration in
    description. Who, for instance, can tolerate this picture of a young man's foot shod
    with a blue buskin?</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>L'animato del pi&egrave; molle alabastro<br />
        </span> <span>Che oscura il latte del sentier celeste<br />
        </span> <span>Stretto alla gamba con purpureo nastro<br />
        </span> <span>Di cuoio azzurro un borsacchin gli veste.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Again he carries to the point of lunacy that casuistical rhetoric, introduced by
    Ariosto and refined upon by Tasso, with which luckless heroines or heroes <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>{281}</span> announce their doubts
    and difficulties to the world in long soliloquies. The ten stanzas which set forth
    Falserina's feelings after she has felt the pangs of love for Adonis, might pass for
    a parody:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Ardo, lassa, o non ardo! ah&igrave; qual io sento<br />
        </span> <span>Stranio nel cor non conosciuto affetto!<br />
        </span> <span>E forse ardore? ardor non &egrave;, ch&egrave; spento<br />
        </span> <span>L'avrei col pianto; &egrave; ben d'ardor sospetto!<br />
        </span> <span>Sospetto no, piuttosto egli &egrave; tormento.<br />
        </span> <span>Come tormento fia, se da diletto?<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>And so forth through eighty lines in which every conceivable change is rung upon
    <i>Amo o non amo?_._._._Io vivo e moro pur_._._._Io non ho core e lo mio cor n'ha
    dui</i>. With all this effort no one is convinced of Falserina's emotion, and her
    long-winded oration reads like a schoolboy's exercise upon some line of the fourth
    Aeneid. Yet if we allow the sense of rhythmical melody to intervene between our
    intellectual perception and Marino's language, we shall still be able to translate
    these outpourings into something which upon the operatic stage would keep its value.
    False rhetoric and the inability to stop when enough and more than enough has been
    said upon any theme to be developed, are the incurable defects of Marino. His profuse
    <i>fioriture</i> compared with the simpler descant of Ariosto or Tasso remind us of
    Rossini's florid roulades beside the grace of Pergolese's or the majesty of
    Marcello's song.</p>
    <p>The peculiar quality of bad taste which is known in Italy as <i>Marinismo</i>,
    consisted in a perpetual <span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"
    id="page282"></a>{282}</span> straining after effect by antitheses, conceits, plans
    on words degenerating into equivocation, and such-like rhetorical grimaces. Marino's
    <i>ars poetica</i> was summed up in this sentence: 'Chi non sa far stupir, vada alia
    striglia.' Therefore, he finds periphrases for the simplest expressions. He calls the
    nightingale <i>sirena de'boschi</i>, gunpowder <i>l'irreparabil fulmine terreno</i>,
    Columbus <i>il ligure Argonauta</i>, Galileo <i>il novello Endimione</i>. In these
    instances, what might have been expanded into a simile, is substituted for the proper
    word in order to surprise the reader. When he alludes to Dante, he poses a conundrum
    on that poet's surname: <i>Ben sull'ali liggier tre mondi canta</i>. The younger
    Palma is complimented on wresting the <i>palm</i> from Titian and Veronese. Guido
    Reni is apostrophized as: <i>Reni onde il maggior Reno all'altro cede</i><a
    name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197"
    class="fnanchor">[197]</a> We are never safe in reading his pages from the whirr and
    whistle of such verbal fireworks. And yet it must be allowed that Marino's style is
    on the whole freer from literary affectations than that of our own Euphuists. It is
    only at intervals that the temptation to make a point by clever trickery seems
    irresistible. When he is seriously engaged upon a topic that stirs his nature to the
    depth, as in the eighth canto, description flows on for stanza after stanza with
    limpid swiftness. Another kind of artifice to which he has resort, is the repetition
    of a dominant word:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>{283}</span> <span>Con

        </span> <span>Degno cambio d'amore &egrave; solo amore.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This play on a word sometimes passes over into a palpable pun, as in the following
    pretty phrase:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>O mia dorata ed adorata Dea.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Still we feel that Shakespeare was guilty of precisely the same verbal
    impertinences. It is only intensity of feeling which prevents such lines as:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Take all my loves, my love, yea take them all;<br />
        </span> <span>What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<br />
        </span> <span>No love, my love, that thou may'st true love call:<br />
        </span> <span>All mine was thine, before thou hadst this more:<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>from being Marinistic. But it must be added that this intensity of feeling renders
    the artifice employed sublimely natural. Here we lay our finger on the crucial point
    at issue in any estimate of literary mannerism. What is the force of thought, the
    fervor of emotion, the acute perception of truth in nature and in man, which lies
    behind that manneristic screen? If, as in the case of Shakespeare, sufficiency or
    superabundance of these essential elements is palpable, we pardon, we ignore, the
    euphuism. But should the quality of substance fail, then we repudiate it and despise
    it. Therefore Marino, who is certainly not more euphuistic than Shakespeare, but who
    has immeasurably less of potent stuff in him, wears the motley of his barocco style
    in limbo bordering upon oblivion, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"
    id="page284"></a>{284}</span> while the Swan of Avon parades the same literary livery
    upon both summits of Parnassus. So true it is that poetry cannot be estimated apart
    from intellectual and moral contents. Had Marino written:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down:<br />
        </span>

    <p>or:</p>

        </span> <span>The prick of noon:<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>he would have furnished his accusers with far stronger diatribes against words of
    double meaning and licentious conceits than his own pages offer. But since it was out
    of the fullness of world-wisdom that Shakespeare penned those phrases for Mercutio,
    and set them as pendants to the impassioned descants upon love and death which he
    poured from the lips of Romeo, they pass condoned and unperceived.</p>
    <p>Only poverty of matter and insincerity of fancy damn in Marino those literary
    affectations which he held in common with a host of writers&mdash;with Gorgias,
    Aeschylus, Chaeremon, Philostratus, among Greeks; with Petrarch, Boccaccio, Bembo,
    Aretino, Tasso, Guarini, among Italians; with Calderon and Cervantes, not to mention
    Gongora, among Spaniards; with the foremost French and English writers of the
    Renaissance; with all verbal artists in any age, who have sought unduly to refine
    upon their material of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"
    id="page285"></a>{285}</span> language. In a word, Marino is not condemned by his
    so-called Marinism. His true stigma is the inadequacy to conceive of human nature
    except under a twofold mask of sensuous voluptuousness and sensuous ferocity. It is
    this narrow and ignoble range of imagination which constitutes his real inferiority,
    far more than any poetical extravagance in diction. The same mean conception of
    humanity brands with ignominy the four generations over which he dominated&mdash;that
    brood of eunuchs and courtiers, churchmen and <i>Cavalieri serventi</i>, barocco
    architects and brigands, casuists and bravi, grimacers, hypocrites, confessors,
    impostors, bastards of the spirit, who controlled Italian culture for a hundred
    years.</p>
    <p>At a first glance we shall be astonished to find that this poet, who may justly be
    regarded as the corypheus of Circean orgies in the seventeenth century, left in MS. a
    grave lament upon the woes of Italy. Marino's <i>Pianto d'Italia</i> has no trace of
    Marinism. It is composed with sobriety in a pedestrian style of plainness, and it
    tells the truth without reserve. Italy traces her wretchedness to one sole cause,
    subjection under Spanish rule.</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Lascio ch'un re che di real non tiene<br />
        </span> <span>Altro che il nome effemminato e vile<br />
        </span> <span>A sua voglia mi reggi, e di catene<br />
        </span> <span>Barbare mi circondi il pi&egrave; servile.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This tyrant foments jealousy and sows seeds of discord between the Italian states.
    His viceroys <span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>{286}</span>
    are elected from the cruelest, the most unjust, the most rapacious, and the most
    luxurious of the courtiers crawling round his throne. The College of Cardinals is
    bought and sold. No prince dares move a finger in his family or state without
    consulting the Iberian senate; still less can he levy troops for self-defense. Yet
    throughout Europe Spanish victories have been obtained by Italian generals; the
    bravest soldiers in foreign armies are Italian exiles. Perhaps it may be argued that
    the empty titles which abound in every petty city, the fulsome promises on which
    those miserable vassals found their hopes, are makeweights for such miseries. Call
    them rather chains to bind the nation, lures and birdlime such as snarers use. There
    is but one quarter to which the widowed and discrowned Queen of Nations can appeal
    for succor. She turns to Carlo Emmanuele, Duke of Savoy, to the hills whence cometh
    help. It was not, however, until two centuries after Marino penned these patriotic
    stanzas, that her prayer was answered. And the reflection forced upon us when we read
    the <i>Pianto d'Italia</i>, is that Marino composed it to flatter a patron who at
    that moment entertained visionary schemes of attacking the Spanish hegemony.</p>
    <p>To make any but an abrupt transition from Marino to Chiabrera would be impossible.
    It is like passing from some luxurious grove of oranges and roses to a barren
    hill-top without prospect over sea or champaign. We are fortunate in possessing a few
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>{287}</span> pages of
    autobiography, from which all that is needful to remember of Gabriello Chiabrera's
    personal history may be extracted. He was born in 1552 at Savona, fifteen days after
    his father's death. His mother made a second marriage, and left him to the care of an
    uncle, with whom at the age of nine he went to reside in Rome. In the house of this
    bachelor uncle the poor little orphan pined away. Fever succeeded fever, until his
    guardian felt that companionship with boys in play and study was the only chance of
    saving so frail a life as Gabriello's. Accordingly he placed the invalid under the
    care of the Jesuits in their Collegio Romano. Here the child's health revived, and
    his education till the age of twenty throve apace. The Jesuits seem to have been
    liberal in their course of training; for young Chiabrera benefited by private
    conversation with Paolo Manuzio and Sperone Speroni, while he attended the lectures
    of Muretus in the university.</p>
    <p>How different was this adolescence from that of Marino! Both youths grew to
    manhood without domestic influences; and both were conspicuous in after life for the
    want of that affection which abounds in Tasso. But here the parallel between them
    ends. Marino, running wild upon the streets of Naples, taking his fill of pleasure
    and adventure, picking up ill-digested information at hap-hazard, and forming his
    poetic style as nature prompted; Chiabrera, disciplined in piety and morals by Jesuit
    directors, imbued with erudition by an arid scholar, a formal <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>{288}</span> pedant and an
    accomplished rhetorician, the three chief representatives of decadent Italian
    humanism: no contrast can be imagined greater than that which marked these two lads
    out for diverse paths in literature. The one was formed to be the poet of caprice and
    license, openly ranking with those</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Che la ragion sommettono al talento,<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>and making <i>s'ei piace ei lice</i> his rule of conduct and of art. The other
    received a rigid bent toward decorum, in religious observances, in ethical severity,
    and in literature of a strictly scholastic type.</p>
    <p>Yet Chiabrera was not without the hot blood of Italian youth. His uncle died, and
    he found himself alone in the world. After spending a few years in the service of
    Cardinal Cornaro, he quarreled with a Roman gentleman, vindicated his honor by some
    act of violence, and was outlawed from the city. Upon this he retired to Savona; and
    here again he met with similar adventures. Wounded in a brawl, he took the law into
    his own hands, and revenged himself upon his assailant. This punctilio proved him to
    be a true child of his age; and if we may credit his own account of both incidents,
    he behaved himself as became a gentleman of the period. It involved him, however, in
    serious annoyances both at Rome and Savona, from which he only extricated himself
    with difficulty and which impaired his fortune. Up to the age of fifty he remained
    unmarried, and then took a wife by whom he had no <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page289" id="page289"></a>{289}</span> children. He lived to the ripe age of
    eighty-four, always at Savona, excepting occasional visits to friends in Italian
    cities, and he died unmolested by serious illness after his first entrance into the
    Collegio Romano. How he occupied the leisure of that lengthy solitude may be gathered
    from his published works&mdash;two or three thick volumes of lyrics; four bulky poems
    of heroic narrative; twelve dramas, including two tragedies; thirty satires or
    epistles; and about forty miscellaneous poems in divers meters. In a word, he devoted
    his whole life to the art of poetry, for which he was not naturally gifted, and which
    he pursued in a gravely methodical spirit. It may be said at once that the body of
    his work, with the exception of some simple pieces of occasion, and a few chastely
    written epistles, is such as nobody can read without weariness.</p>
    <p>Before investigating Chiabrera's claim to rank among Italian poets, it may be well
    to examine his autobiography in those points which touch upon the temper of society.
    Short as it is, this document is precious for the light it casts upon contemporary
    custom. As a writer, Chiabrera was distinguished by sobriety of judgment, rectitude,
    piety, purity of feeling, justice toward his fellow-workers in literature, and an
    earnest desire to revive the antique virtues among his countrymen. There is no reason
    to suppose that these estimable qualities did not distinguish him in private life.
    Yet eight out of the eighteen pages of his biography are devoted to <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>{290}</span> comically solemn
    details regarding the honors paid him by Italian princes. The Grand Duke of Florence,
    Ferdinand I., noticed him standing with uncovered head at a theatrical representation
    in the Pitti Palace. He bade the poet put his cap on and sit down. Cosimo, the heir
    apparent, showed the same condescending courtesy. When he was at Turin, Carlo
    Emmanuele, Duke of Savoy, placed a coach and pair at his disposal, and allowed him
    300 lire for traveling expenses to and from Savona. But this prince omitted to
    appoint him lodgings in the palace, nor did he invite him to cover in the presence.
    This perhaps is one reason why Chiabrera refused the duke's offer of a secretaryship
    at Court. Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, on the contrary, allotted him rooms and
    always suffered him to keep his hat on. The Pope, who was an old college friend of
    Chiabrera, made him handsome presents, and on one delightful occasion allowed him to
    hear a sermon in the Papal pew. The Doge of Genoa, officially particular in points of
    etiquette, always took care to bid him cover, although he was a subject born of the
    Republic.</p>
    <p>Basely insignificant as are these details, they serve to show what value was then
    ascribed even by men of real respectability to trifling princely favors. The unction
    with which Chiabrera relates them, warming his cold style into a glow of
    satisfaction, is a practical satire upon his endeavor to resuscitate the virtues of
    antique republics in that Italy. To <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"
    id="page291"></a>{291}</span> do this was his principal aim as a moralist; to revive
    the grand style of Pindar was his object as an artist. Each attempt involved
    impossibility, and argued a visionary ambition dimly conscious of its scope. Without
    freedom, without the living mythology of Hellas, without a triumphant national cause,
    in the very death of independence, at the end of a long age of glorious but
    artificial culture, how could Chiabrera dare to pose as Pindar? Instead of the youth
    of Greece ascending with free flight and all the future of the world before it,
    decrepit Italy, the Italy so rightly drawn by Marino in his <i>Pianto</i>, lay
    groveling in the dust of decaying thrones. Her lyrist had to sing of pallone-matches
    instead of Panhellenic games; to celebrate the heroic conquest of two Turkish galleys
    by a Tuscan fleet, instead of Marathon and Salamis; to praise S. Lucy and S. Paul
    with tepid fervor, instead of telling how Rhodes swam at her god's bidding upward
    from the waves.</p>
    <p>One example will serve as well as many to illustrate the false attitude assumed by
    Chiabrera when he posed as a new Pindar in the midst of seventeenth-century Italians.
    I will select the Ode to Don Cesare d'Este. There is something pathetically
    ridiculous, in this would-be swan of the Dircean fount, this apostle of pagan
    virtues, admonishing the heir of Alfonso II to prove himself an obedient son of the
    Church by relinquishing his Duchy of Ferrara to the Holy See. The poet asks him, in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>{292}</span> fine classic
    phrases, whether he could bear to look on desecrated altars, confessionals without
    absolving priests, chapels without choristers, a people barred with bolt and lock
    from Paradise. How trivial are earthly compared with heavenly crowns! How vulgar is
    the love of power and gold! The exhortation, exquisite enough in chastened style,
    closes with this hypocritical appeal to Cesare's aristocratic prejudices:</p>
    <div class="poem">
      <div class="stanza">
        <span>Parli la plebe a suo volere, e pensi&mdash;<br />
        </span> <span>Non con la plebe hanno da gir gli Estensi.<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>That is to say, nobility demands that the House of Este should desert its
    subjects, sacrifice its throne, crawl at a Pontiff's feet, and starve among a crowd
    of disthroned princes, wrapping the ragged purple of its misery around it till it,
    too, mixes with the people it contemns.</p>
    <p>Hopeless as the venture was, Chiabrera made it the one preoccupation of his life,
    in these untoward circumstances, to remodel Italian poetry upon the Greek pattern. It
    was a merit of the Sei Cento, a sign of grace, that the Italians now at last threw
    orthodox aesthetic precepts to the winds, and avowed their inability to carry the
    Petrarchistic tradition further. The best of them, Campanella and Bruno, molded
    vulgar language like metal in the furnace of a vehement imagination, making it the
    vehicle of fantastic passion and enthusiastic philosophy. From their crucible the
    Sonnet and the Ode emerged with no resemblance to academical <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page293" id="page293"></a>{293}</span> standards. Grotesque, angular, gnarled,
    contorted, Gothic even, these antiquated forms beneath their wayward touch were
    scarcely recognizable. They had become the receptacles of burning, scalding,
    trenchant realities. Salvator Rosa, next below the best, forced indignation to lend
    him wings, and scaled Parnassus with brass-bound feet and fury. Marino, bent on
    riveting attention by surprises, fervid with his own reality of lust, employed the
    octave stanza as a Turkish Bey might use an odalisque. 'The only rule worth thinking
    of,' he said, 'is to know how and when and where to break all rules, adapting
    ourselves to current taste and the fashions of the age.' His epic represents a
    successful, because a vivid, reaction against conventionality. The life that throbs
    in it is incontestable, even though that life may be nothing better than ephemeral.
    With like brutality of instinct, healthy because natural, the barocco architects
    embraced ugliness, discord, deformity, spasm, as an escape from harmony and
    regularity with which the times were satiated. Prose-writers burst the bonds of
    Bembo, trampled on Boccaccio, reveled in the stylistic debaucheries of Bartolo.
    Painters, rendered academic in vain by those Fabii of Bologna who had striven to
    restore the commonwealth of art by temporizing, launched themselves upon a sea of
    massacre and murder, blood and entrails, horrors of dark woods and Bacchanalia of
    chubby Cupids. The popular Muse of Italy meanwhile emerged with furtive <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>{294}</span> grace and
    inexhaustible vivacity in dialectic poems, dances, Pulcinello, Bergamasque Pantaloon,
    and what of parody and satire, Harlequinades, and carnival diversions, any local soil
    might cherish.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> All this revolt against
    precedent, this resurrection of primeval instinct, crude and grinning, took place,
    let us remember, under the eyes of the Jesuits, within the shadow of the Inquisition,
    in an age reformed and ordered by the Council of Trent. Art was following Aretino,
    the reprobate and rebel. He first amid the languors of the golden age&mdash;and this
    is Aretino's merit&mdash;discerned that the only escape from its inevitable
    exhaustion was by passing over into crudest naturalism.</p>
    <p>But for Chiabrera, the excellent gentleman, the patronized of princes, scrupulous
    upon the point of honor, pupil of Jesuits, pious, twisted back on humanism by his
    Roman tutors, what escape was left for him? Obey the genius of his times he must.
    Innovate he must. He chose the least indecorous sphere at hand for innovation; and
    felt therewith most innocently happy. Without being precisely conscious of it, he had
    discovered a way of adhering to time-honored precedent while following the general
    impulse to discard precedent. He threw Petrarch overboard, but he took on Pindar for
    his pilot. 'When I see anything eminently beautiful, or hear something, or taste
    something that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>{295}</span>
    is excellent, I say: It is Greek Poetry.' In this self-revealing sentence lies the
    ruling instinct of the man as scholar. The highest praise he can confer upon Italian
    matters, is to call them Greek Poetry. 'When I have to express my aims in verse, I
    compare myself to Columbus, who said that he would discover a new world or drown.'
    Again, in this self-revealing sentence, Chiabrera betrays the instinct which in
    common with his period he obeyed. He was bound to startle society by a discovery or
    to drown. For this, be it remembered, was the time in which Pallavicino, like Marino,
    declared that poetry must make men raise their eyebrows in astonishment. For
    Chiabrera, educated as he had been, that new world toward which he navigated was a
    new Hellenic style of Italian poetry; and the Theban was to guide him toward its
    shores. But on the voyage Chiabrera drowned: drowned for eternity in hyper-atlantic
    whirlpools of oblivion. Some critics, pitying so lofty, so respectable an ambition,
    have whispered that he found a little Island of the Blest and there planted modest
    myrtles of mediocre immortality. Yet this is not the truth. On such a quest there was
    only failure or success. He did not succeed. His cold mincemeat from Diocean tables,
    tepid historic parallels, artificially concocted legends, could not create Greek
    poetry again beneath the ribs of death. The age was destined to be saved by music.
    License was its only liberty, as the <i>Adone</i> taught. Unmusical Chiabrera,
    buckram'd <span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> up by
    old mythologies and sterling precepts, left its life untouched. His antique virtues
    stood, like stucco gods and goddesses, on pedestals in garden groves, and moldered.
    His Pindaric flights were such as a sparrow, gazing upward at a hawk, might venture
    on. Those abrupt transitions, whereby he sought to simulate the lordly
    <i>sprezzatura</i> of the Theban eagle, 'soaring with supreme dominion in the azure
    depths of air,' remind us mainly of the hoppings of a frog. Chiabrera failed: failed
    all the more lamentably because he was so scholarly, so estimable. He is chiefly
    interesting now as the example of a man devoted to the Church, a pupil of Jesuits, a
    moralist, and a humanist, in some sense also a patriot, who felt the temper of his
    time, and strove to innovate in literature. Devoid of sincere sympathy with his
    academically chosen models, thinking he had discovered a safe path for innovation, he
    fell flat in the slime and perished.</p>
    <p>Marino had human life and vulgar nature, the sensualities and frivolities of the
    century, to help him. Chiabrera claimed none of these advantages. What had Tassoni
    for his outfit? Sound common sense, critical acumen, the irony of humor, hatred of
    tyrants and humbug, an acrid temper mollified by genial love of letters, a manly
    spirit of independence. Last, but not least, he inherited something of the old
    Elysian smile which played upon the lips of Ariosto, from which Tasso's melancholy
    shrank discomfited, which Marino smothered in the kisses of his courtesans, and<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>{297}</span> Chiabrera banned as
    too ignoble for Dircean bards. This smile it was that cheered Tassoni's leisure when,
    fallen on evil days, he penned the <i>Socchia Rapita</i>.</p>
    <p>Alessandro Tassoni was born in 1565 of a noble Modenese family. Before completing
    his nineteenth year he won the degree of Doctor of Laws, and afterwards spent twelve
    years in studying at the chief universities of Lombardy. Between 1599 and 1603 he
    served the Cardinal Ascanio Colonna both in Spain and Rome, as secretary. The insight
    he then gained into the working of Spanish despotism made him a relentless enemy of
    that already decadent monarchy. When Carlo Emmanuele, Duke of Savoy, sent back his
    Collar of the Golden Fleece in 1613 and drew the sword of resistance against Philip
    III., Tassoni penned two philippics against Spaniards, which are the firmest, most
    embittered expression of patriotism as it then existed. He had the acuteness to
    perceive that the Spanish state was no longer in its prime of vigor, and the noble
    ingenuousness to dream that Italian princes might be roused to sink their rancors in
    a common effort after independence. As a matter of fact, Estensi, Medici, Farnesi,
    Gonzaghi, all the reigning houses as yet unabsorbed by Church or Spain, preferred the
    predominance of a power which sanctioned their local tyrannies, irksome and degrading
    as that overlordship was, to the hegemony of Piedmontese Macedon. And like all
    Italian patriots, strong in mind, feeble in muscle, he failed to reckon with the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>{298}</span> actual
    soldierly superiority of Spaniards. Italy could give generals at this epoch to her
    masters; but she could not count on levying privates for her own defense. Carlo
    Emmanuele rewarded the generous ardor of Tassoni by grants of pensions which were
    never paid, and by offices at Court which involved the poet-student in perilous
    intrigue. 'My service with the princes of the House of Savoy,' so he wrote at a later
    period, 'did not take its origin in benefits or favors received or expected. It
    sprang from a pure spontaneous motion of the soul, which inspired me with love for
    the noble character of Duke Charles.' When he finally withdrew from that service, he
    had his portrait painted. In his hands he held a fig, and beneath the picture ran a
    couplet ending with the words, 'this the Court gave me.' Throughout his life Tassoni
    showed an independence rare in that century. His principal works were published
    without dedications to patrons. In the preface to his <i>Remarks on Petrarch</i> he
    expressed his opinion thus: 'I leave to those who like them the fruitless
    dedications, not to say flatteries, which are customary nowadays. I seek no
    protection; for a lie does not deserve it, and truth is indifferent to it. Let such
    as opine that the shadow of great personages can conceal the ineptitude of authors,
    make the most of this advantage.' Believing firmly in astrology, he judged that his
    own horoscope condemned him to ill-success. It appears that he was born under the
    influence of Saturn, when the sun <span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"
    id="page299"></a>{299}</span> and moon were in conjunction; and he held that this
    combination of the heavenly bodies boded 'things noteworthy, yet not felicitous.' It
    was, however, difficult for a man of Tassoni's condition in that state of society to
    draw breath outside the circle of a Court. Accordingly, in 1626, he entered the
    service of the Pope's nephew, Cardinal Lodovisio. He did not find this much to his
    liking: 'I may compare myself to P. Emilius Metellus, when he was shod with those
    elegant boots which pinched his feet. Everybody said, Oh what fine boots, how well
    they fit! But the wretch was unable to walk in them.' On the Cardinal's death in 1632
    Tassoni removed to the Court of Francesco I. of Modena, and died there in 1635.</p>
    <p>As a writer, Tassoni, in common with the best spirits of his time, aimed at
    innovation. It had become palpable to the Italians that the Renaissance was over, and
    that they must break with the traditions of the past. This, as I have already pointed
    out, was the saving virtue of the early seventeenth century; but what good fruits it
    might have fostered, had not the political and ecclesiastical conditions of the age
    been adverse, remains a matter for conjecture. 'It is my will and object to utter new
    opinions,' he wrote to a friend; and acting upon this principle, he attacked the
    chief prejudices of his age in philosophy and literature. One of his earliest
    publications was a miscellaneous collection of <i>Divers Thoughts</i>, in which he
    derided Aristotle's Physics <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
    id="page300"></a>{300}</span> and propounded speculations similar to those developed
    by Gassendi. He dared to cast scorn on Homer, as rude and barbarous, poor in the
    faculty of invention, taxable with at least five hundred flagrant defects. How little
    Tassoni really comprehended Homer may be judged from his complacent assertion that
    the episode of Luna and Endymion (<i>Secchia Rapita</i>, canto viii.) was composed in
    the Homeric manner. In truth he could estimate the Iliad and Odyssey no better than
    Chiabrera could the Pythians and Olympians of Pindar. A just sense of criticism
    failed the scholars of that age, which was too remote in its customs, too imperfect
    in its science of history, to understand the essence of Greek art. With equally
    amusing candor Tassoni passed judgments upon Dante, and thought that he had rivaled
    the Purgatory in his description of the Dawn (<i>Secchia Rapita</i>, viii. 15, the
    author's note). We must, however, be circumspect and take these criticisms with a
    grain of salt; for one never knows how far Tassoni may be laughing in his sleeve.
    There is no doubt, however, regarding the sincerity of his strictures upon the Della
    Cruscan Vocabulary of 1612, or the more famous inquiry into Petrarch's style. The
    <i>Considerazioni sopra le Rime del Petrarca</i> were composed in 1602-3 during a sea
    voyage from Genoa to Spain. They told what now must be considered the plain truth of
    common sense about the affectations into which a servile study of the
    <i>Canzoniere</i> had betrayed generations of Italian <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page301" id="page301"></a>{301}</span> rhymesters. Tassoni had in view
    Petrarch's pedantic imitators rather than their master; and when the storm of
    literary fury, stirred up by his work, was raging round him, he thus established his
    position: 'Surely it is allowable to censure Petrarch's poems, if a man does this,
    not from malignant envy, but from a wish to remove the superstitions and abuses which
    beget such evil effects, and to confound the sects of the Rabbins hardened in their
    perfidy of obsolete opinion, and in particular of such as think they cannot write
    straight without the <i>falsariga</i> of their model.' I may observe in passing that
    the points in this paragraph are borrowed from a sympathizing letter which Marino
    addressed to the author on his essay. In another place Tassoni stated, 'It was never
    my intention to speak evil of this poet [Petrarch], whom I have always admired above
    any lyrist of ancient or modern times.'</p>
    <p>So independent in his conduct and so bold in his opinions was the author of the
    <i>Secchia Rapita</i>. The composition of this poem grew out of the disputes which
    followed Tassoni's <i>Remarks on Petrarch</i>. He found himself assailed by two
    scurrilous libels, which were traced to the Count Alessandro Brusantini, feudal lord
    of Culagna and Bismozza. Justice could not be obtained upon the person of so eminent
    a noble. Tassoni, with true Italian refinement, resolved to give himself the unique
    pleasure of ingenious vengeance. The name of the Count's fief supplied him with a
    standing dish of sarcasm. He <span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"
    id="page302"></a>{302}</span> would write a satiric poem, of which the Conte Culagna
    should be the burlesque hero. After ten months' labor, probably in the year 1615, the
    <i>Secchia Rapita</i> already went abroad in MS.<a name="FNanchor_199_199"
    id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
    Tassoni sought to pass it off as a product of his youth; but both the style and the
    personalities which it contained rendered this impossible. Privately issued, the poem
    had a great success. 'In less than a year,' writes the author, 'more MS. copies were
    in circulation than are usually sent forth from the press in ten years of the most
    famous works.' One professional scribe made 200 ducats in the course of a few months
    by reproducing it; and the price paid for each copy was eight crowns. It became
    necessary to publish the <i>Secchia Rapita</i>. But now arose innumerable
    difficulties. The printers of Modena and Padua refused; Giuliano Cassiani had been
    sent to prison in 1617 for publishing some verses of Testi against Spain. The
    Inquisition withheld its <i>imprimatur</i>. Attempts were made to have it printed on
    the sly at Padua; but the craftsman who engaged to execute this job was imprisoned.
    At last, in 1622, Tassoni contrived to have the poem published in Paris. The edition
    soon reached Italy. In Rome it was prohibited, but freely sold; and at last Gregory
    XV. allowed it to be reprinted with some canceled passages. There is, in truth,
    nothing prejudicial either to the Catholic creed or to general morality in the
    <i>Secchia Rapita</i>. We note, meanwhile, with interest, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page303" id="page303"></a>{303}</span> that it first saw the light at Paris,
    sharing thus the fortunes of the <i>Adone</i>, which it preceded by one year. If the
    greatest living Italians at this time were exiles, it appears that the two most
    eminent poems of their literature first saw the light on foreign shores.</p>
    <p>The <i>Secchia Rapita</i> is the first example of heroico-comic poetry. Tassoni
    claims in print the honor of inventing this new species, and tells his friends that
    'though he will not pique himself on being a poet, still he sets some store on having
    discovered a new kind of poem and occupied a vacant seat.' The seat&mdash;and it was
    no Siege Perilous&mdash;stood indeed empty and ready to be won by any free-lance of
    letters. Folengo had burlesqued romance. But no one as yet had made a parody of that
    which still existed mainly as the unaccomplished hope of literature. Trissino with
    his <i>Italia Liberata</i>, Tasso with his <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i>, tried to
    persuade themselves and the world that they had succeeded in delivering Italy in
    labor of an epic. But their maieutic ingenuity was vain. The nation carried no epic
    in her womb. Trissino's <i>Italia</i> was a weazened changeling of erudition, and
    Tasso's <i>Gerusalemme</i> a florid bastard of romance. Tassoni, noticing the
    imposition of these two eminent and worthy writers, determined to give his century an
    epic or heroic poem in the only form which then was possible. Briefly, he produced a
    caricature, modeled upon no existing work of modern art, but corresponding to the
    lineaments of that Desired of the Nation <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"
    id="page304"></a>{304}</span> which pedants had prophesied. Unity of action celestial
    machinery, races in conflict, contrasted heroes, the wavering chance of war,
    episodes, bards, heroines, and love subordinated to the martial motive&mdash;all
    these features of the epic he viewed through the distorting medium of his comic
    art.</p>
    <p>In the days of the second Lombard League, when Frederick II. was fighting a losing
    battle with the Church, Guelf Bologna came into grim conflict with her Ghibelline
    neighbor Modena. The territory of these two cities formed the <i>champ clos</i> of a
    duel in which the forces of Germany and nearly all Italy took part; and in one
    engagement, at Fossalta, the Emperor's heir, King Enzo of Sardinia, was taken
    captive. How he passed the rest of his days, a prisoner of the Bolognese, and how he
    begat the semi-royal brood of Bentivogli, is matter of history and legend. During
    this conflict memorable among the many municipal wars of Italy in the middle ages, it
    happened that some Modenese soldiers, who had pushed their way into the suburbs of
    Bologna, carried off a bucket and suspended it as a trophy in the bell-tower of the
    cathedral, where it may still be seen. One of the peculiarities of those mediaeval
    struggles which roused the rivalry of towns separated from each other by a few miles
    of fertile country, and which raged through generations till the real interests at
    issue were confounded in blind animosity of neighbor against neighbor&mdash;was the
    sense of humor and of sarcasm they encouraged. To hurl <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span> dead donkey against your enemy's
    town-wall passed for a good joke, and discredited his honor more than the loss of a
    hundred fighting men in a pitched battle. Frontier fortresses received insulting
    names, like the Perugian <i>Becca di questo</i>, or like the Bolognese
    <i>Grevalcore</i>. There was much, in fact, in these Italian wars which reminds one
    of the hostilities between rival houses in a public school.</p>
    <p>Such being the element of humor ready to hand in the annals of his country,
    Tassoni chose the episode of the Bolognese bucket for the theme of a mock-heroic
    epic. He made what had been an insignificant incident the real occasion of the war,
    and grouped the facts of history around it by ingenious distortions of the truth. The
    bucket is the Helen of his Iliad:<a name="FNanchor_200_200"

    <p>A mere trifle thus becomes a point of dispute capable of bringing gods, popes,
    emperors, kings, princes, cities, and whole nations into conflict. At the same time
    the satirist betrays his malice by departing as little as possible from the main
    current of actual events. History lends verisimilitude to the preposterous assumption
    that heaven and earth were drawn into a squabble about a bucket: and if there is any
    moral to be derived from the <i>Secchia Rapita</i> we have it here. At the end of the

    <p>Such is the main subject of the <i>Secchia Rapita</i>; and such is Tassoni's
    irony, an irony worthy of Aristophanes in its far-reaching indulgent contempt for
    human circumstance. But the poem has another object. It was written to punish Count
    Alessandro Brusantini. The leading episode, which occupies about three cantos of the
    twelve, is an elaborate vilification of this personal enemy travestied as the
    contemptible Conte di Culagna.</p>
    <p>Tassoni's method of art corresponds to the irony of his inspiration. We find his
    originality in a peculiar blending of serious and burlesque styles, in abrupt but
    always well-contrived transitions from heroical magniloquence to plebeian farce and
    from scurrility to poetic elevation, finally in a frequent employment of the figure
    which the Greeks called [Greek: para prosdokian]. His poem is a parody of the
    Aristophanic type. 'Like a fantastically ironical magic tree, the world-subversive
    idea which lies at the root of it springs up with blooming ornament of thoughts, with
    singing nightingales and climbing chattering apes.'<a name="FNanchor_202_202"
    id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> To
    seek a central motive or a sober <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"
    id="page307"></a>{307}</span> meaning in this caprice of the satirical imagination
    would be idle. Tassoni had no intention, as some critics have pretended, to exhibit
    the folly of those party wars which tore the heart of Italy three centuries before
    his epoch, to teach the people of his day the miseries of foreign interference, or to
    strike a death-blow at classical mythology. The lesson which can be drawn from his
    cantos, that man in warfare disquiets himself in vain for naught, that a bucket is as
    good a <i>casus belli</i> as Helen, the moral which Southey pointed in his ballad of
    the Battle of Blenheim, emerges, not from the poet's design, but from the inevitable
    logic of his humor. Pique inspired the <i>Secchia Rapita</i>, and in the despicable
    character of Count Culagna he fully revenged the slight which had been put upon him.
    The revenge is savage, certainly; for the Count remains 'immortally immerded' in the
    long-drawn episode which brought to view the shame of his domestic life. Yet while
    Tassoni drew blood, he never ceased to smile; and Count Culagna remains for us a
    personage of comedy rather than of satire.</p>
    <p>In the next place, Tassoni meant to ridicule the poets of his time. He calls the
    <i>Secchia Rapita</i> 'an absurd caprice, written to burlesque the modern poets.' His
    genius was nothing if not critical, and literature afforded him plenty of material
    for fun. Romance-writers with their jousts and duels and armed heroines, would-be
    epic poets with their extra-mundane machinery and pomp of phrase,<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>{308}</span> Marino and his
    hyperbolical conceits, Tuscan purists bent on using only words of the Tre Cento,
    Petrarchisti spinning cobwebs of old metaphors and obsolete periphrases, all felt in
    turn the touch of his light lash. The homage paid to Petrarch's stuffed cat at
    Arqu&agrave; supplied him with a truly Aristophanic gibe.<a name="FNanchor_203_203"
    id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>
    Society comes next beneath his ferule. There is not a city of Italy which Tassoni did
    not wring in the withers of its self-conceit. The dialects of Ferrara, Bologna,
    Bergamo, Florence, Rome, lend the satirist vulgar phrases when he quits the grand
    style and, taking Virgil's golden trumpet from his lips, slides off into a
    <i>canaille</i> drawl or sluice of Billingsgate. Modena is burlesqued in her
    presiding Potta, gibbeted for her filthy streets. The Sienese discover that the world
    accounts them lunatics. The Florentines and Perugians are branded for notorious vice.
    Roman foppery, fantastical in feminine pretentiousness, serves as a foil to drag
    Culagna down into the ditch of ignominy. Here and there, Tassoni's satire is both
    venomous and pungent, as when he paints the dotage of the Empire, stabs Spanish pride
    of sovereignty, and menaces the Papacy with insurrection. But for the most part, like
    Horace in the phrase of Persius, he plays about the vitals of the victims who admit
    him to their confidence&mdash;<i>admissus circum praecordia ludit</i>.</p>
    <p>We can but regret that so clear-sighted, so <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page309" id="page309"></a>{309}</span> urbane and so truly Aristophanic a
    satirist had not a wider field to work in. Seventeenth-century Italy was all too
    narrow for his genius; and if the <i>Secchia Rapita</i> has lost its savor, this is
    less the poet's fault than the defect of his material. He was strong enough to have
    brought the Athens of Cleon, the France of Henri III., or the England of James I.
    within the range of his distorting truth-revealing mirror. Yet, even as it was,
    Tassoni opened several paths for modern humorists. Rabelais might have owned that
    caricature of Mars and Bacchus rioting in a tavern bed with Venus travestied as a
    boy, and in the morning, after breakfasting divinely on two hundred restorative eggs,
    escaping with the fear of a scandalized host and the police-court before their eyes.
    Yet Rabelais would hardly have brought this cynical picture of crude debauchery into
    so fine a contrast with the celestial environment of gods and goddesses. True to his
    principle of effect by alternation, Tassoni sometimes sketches the deities whom he
    derides, in the style of Volpato engravings after Guido. They move across his canvas
    with ethereal grace. What can be more charming than Diana visiting Endymion, and
    confessing to the Loves that all her past career as huntress and as chaste had been
    an error? Venus, too, when she takes that sensuously dreamy all-poetic journey across
    the blue Mediterranean to visit golden-haired King Enzo in his sleep, makes us forget
    her entrance into Modena disguised as a lad trained to play female parts upon the
    stage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>{310}</span> This
    blending of true elegance with broad farce is a novelty in modern literature. We are
    reminded of the songs of the Mystae on the meadows of Elysium in the <i>Frogs</i>.
    Scarron and Voltaire, through the French imitators of Tassoni, took lessons from his
    caricature of Saturn, the old diseased senator traveling in a sedan chair to the
    celestial parliament, with a clyster-pipe in front of him and his seat upon a close
    stool. Moli&egrave;re and Swift, votaries of Cloacina, were anticipated in the climax
    of Count Culagna's attempt to poison his wife, and in the invention of the enchanted
    ass so formidable by Parthian discharges on its adversary. Over these births of
    Tassoni's genius the Maccaronic Muse of Folengo and his Bolognese predecessors
    presided. There is something Lombard, a smack of sausage in the humor. But it
    remained for the Modenese poet to bring this Mafelina into the comity of nations. We
    are not, indeed, bound to pay her homage. Yet when we find her inspiring such writers
    as Swift, Voltaire, Sterne and Heine, it is well to remember that Tassoni first
    evoked her from Mantuan gutters and the tripe-shops of Bologna.</p>
    <p>'The fantastically ironical magic tree' of the <i>Secchia Rapita</i> spread its
    green boughs not merely for chattering baboons. Nightingales sang there. The
    monkey-like Culagna, with his tricks and antics, disappears. Virtuous Renoppia, that
    wholesome country lass, the <i>bourgeois</i> counterpart of Bradamante, withholds her
    slipper from the poet's head <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"
    id="page311"></a>{311}</span> when he is singing sad or lovely things of human
    fortune. Our eyes, rendered sensitive by vulgar sights, dwell with unwonted pleasure
    on the chivalrous beauty of King Enzo. Ernesto's death touches our sympathy with
    pathos, in spite of the innuendo cast upon his comrade Jacon&igrave;a. Paolo
    Malatesta rides with the shades of doom, the Dantesque cloud of love and destiny,
    around his forehead, through that motley mock-heroic band of burghers. Manfredi,
    consumed by an unholy passion for his sister, burns for one moment, like a face
    revealed by lightning, on our vision and is gone. Finally, when the mood seizes him
    (for Tassoni persuades us into thinking he is but the creature of caprice), he tunes
    the soft idyllic harp and sings Endymion's love-tale in strains soft as Marino's,
    sweet as Tasso's, outdoing Marino in delicacy, Tasso in reserve. This episode moved
    rigid Alfieri to admiration. It remains embedded in a burlesque poem, one of the most
    perfectly outlined triumphs of refined Italian romantic art. Yet such was the
    strength of the master's hand, so loyal was he to his principle of contrast, that he
    cuts the melodious idyl short with a twang of the guitar-strings, and strikes up a
    tavern ballad on Lucrezia. The irony which ruled his art demanded this inversion of
    proprieties. Cynthia wooing Endymion shows us woman in her frailty; Lucrece violated
    by Tarquin is woman in her dignity. The ironical poet had to adorn the first story
    with his choicest flowers of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"
    id="page312"></a>{312}</span> style and feeling, to burlesque the second with his
    grossest realism.</p>
    <p>This antithesis between sustained poetry and melodiously-worded slang, between
    radiant forms of beauty and grotesque ugliness, penetrates the <i>Secchia Rapita</i>
    in every canto and in every detail. We pass from battle-scenes worthy of Ariosto and
    Tasso at their best into ditches of liquid dung. Ambassadors are introduced with
    touches that degrade them to the rank of <i>commis voyageurs</i>. Before the senate
    the same men utter orations in the style of Livy. The pomp of war is paraded, its
    machinery of catapults is put in motion, to discharge a dead ass into a besieged
    town; and when the beleagured garrison behold it flying through the air, they do not
    take the donkey for a taunt, but for a heavenly portent. A tournament is held and
    very brave in their attire are all the combatants. But according to its rules the
    greatest sluggard wins the crown of honor. Even in the similes, which formed so
    important an element of epic decoration, the same principle of contrast is
    maintained. Fine vignettes from nature in the style consecrated by Ariosto and Tasso
    introduce ludicrous incidents. Vulgar details picked up from the streets prepare us
    for touches of pathos or poetry.</p>
    <p>Tassoni takes high rank as a literary artist for the firmness with which he
    adhered to his principle of irony, and for the facility of vigor which conceals all
    traces of effort in so difficult a task. I may be thought to have pitched his praise
    too high. But <span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>{313}</span>
    those will forgive me who enjoy the play of pure sharp-witted fancy, or who reflect
    upon the sadness of the theme which occupies my pen in these two volumes.</p>
    <p>Of the four poets to whom this chapter is devoted, Guarini, Marino, and Tassoni
    were successful, Chiabrera was a respectable failure. The reason of this difference
    is apparent. In the then conditions of Italian society, at the close of a great and
    glorious period of varied culture, beneath the shadow of a score of Spaniardizing
    princelings, with the spies of the Inquisition at every corner, and the drill of the
    Tridentine Council to be gone through under Jesuitical direction, there was no place
    for a second Pindar. But there was scope for decorative art, for sensuous indulgence,
    and for genial irony. Happy the man who paced his vineyards, dreaming musically of
    Arcadia! Happy the man who rolled in Circe's pigsty! Happy the man who sat in his
    study and laughed! Therefore the most meritorious productions of the time,
    Boccalini's <i>Ragguagli di Parnaso</i>, Bracciolini's <i>Scherno degli Dei</i>, have
    a touch of Tassoni's humor in them; while Achillini and Preti limp somewhat feebly
    after Marino's Alcibidean swagger, and endless pastorals pullulate from Guarini's
    tragi-comedy. We need not occupy our minds with these secondary writers, nor do more
    than indicate the scholarly niceness with which Filicaja in the second half of the
    seventeenth century continued Chiabrera's tradition. But one word <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> must be said in honor
    of Fulvio Testi, the Modenese poet and statesman, who paid for the fame of a Canzone
    with his head. He has a double interest for us: first, because Leopardi esteemed him
    the noblest of Italian lyrists after Petrarch; secondly, because his fate proved that
    Tasso's dread of assassination was not wholly an illusion. Reading the ode addressed
    to Count Raimondo Montecuccoli, <i>Ruscelletto orgoglioso</i>, the ode which brought
    Testi to the block in a dungeon of the Estensi, we comprehend what Leopardi meant by
    his high panegyric. It is a piece of poetry, lofty in style, grave in movement,
    pregnant with weighty thought, stern and rugged, steeped in a sublimity of gloom and
    Stoicism which remind us of the author of <i>La Ginestra</i>. The century produced
    little that bore a stamp so evident of dignity and greatness.</p>

    </div>
    <p>It is a singular fact that while Italy led all the European races in scholarship
    and literature, in the arts of sculpture and painting, in commerce and the sciences
    of life, she had developed no national school of music in the middle of the sixteenth
    century. Native melody might indeed be heard in abundance along her shores and
    hillsides, in city streets and on the squares where men and girls danced together at
    evening. But such melody was popular; it could not be called artistic or scientific.
    The music which resounded through the Sistine Chapel, beneath the Prophets of Michel
    Angelo, on high days and festivals, was not Italian. The composers of it came for the
    most part from Flemish or French provinces, bearing the names of Josquin
    Depr&egrave;s, of Andrew<span class="pagenum"><a name="page316"
    id="page316"></a>{316}</span> Willaert, of Eleazar Genet, of James Arkadelt, of
    Claude Gondimel; and the performers were in like manner chiefly ultramontanes. Julius
    II. in 1513 founded a chapel in the Vatican Basilica called the Cappella Giulia for
    the maintenance of twelve male singers, twelve boys, and two masters of the
    choristers. In doing so it was his object to encourage a Roman school of music and to
    free the Chapter of S. Peter's from the inconvenience of being forced to engage
    foreign choir-men. His scheme, however, had been only partially successful. As late
    as 1540, we find that the principal composers and musicians in Rome were still
    foreigners. To three Italians of repute, there were five Flemings, three Frenchmen,
    three Spaniards, one German, and one Portuguese.<a name="FNanchor_204_204"
    id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>
    <p>The Flemish style of contrapuntal or figured harmony, which had enchanted Europe
    by its novelty and grace when Josquin Depr&egrave;s, in the last quarter of the
    fifteenth century, brought it into universal vogue, was still dominant in Italy. But
    this style already showed unmistakable signs of decadence and dissolution. It had
    become unfit for ecclesiastical uses, and by the exaggeration of its qualities it was
    tending to anarchy. The grand defect of Flemish music, considered as an art of
    expression, was that it ignored propriety and neglected the libretto. Instead of
    exercising original invention, instead of suiting melodies to words by appropriate
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>{317}</span> combinations of
    sound and sense, the composers chose any musical themes that came to hand, and
    wrought them up into elaborate contrapuntal structures without regard for their book.
    The first words of a passage from the Creed, for instance, were briefly indicated at
    the outset of the number: what followed was but a reiteration of the same syllables,
    and divided in the most arbitrary manner to suit the complicated descant which they
    had to serve. The singers could not adapt their melodic phrases to the liturgical
    text, since sometimes passages of considerable length fell upon a couple of
    syllables, while on the contrary a long sentence might have no more than a bar or
    even less assigned to it. They were consequently in the habit of drawling out or
    gabbling over the words, regardless of both sense and sentiment. Nor was this all.
    The composers of the Flemish school prided themselves on overloading their work with
    every kind of intricate and difficult ornament, exhibiting their dexterity by canons
    of many types, inversions, imitations, contrapuntal devices of divers ingenious and
    distracting species. The verbal theme became a mere basis for the utterance of
    scientific artifices and the display of vocal gymnastics. The singers, for their
    part, were allowed innumerable licenses. While the bass sustained the melody, the
    other voices indulged in extempore descant (<i>composizione alla mente</i>) and in
    extravagances of technical execution (<i>rifiorimenti</i>), regardless of the style
    of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span> main
    composition, violating time, and setting even the fundamental tone at defiance.</p>
    <p>The composers, to advance another step in the analysis of this strange medley,
    took particular delight in combining different sets of words, melodies of widely
    diverse character, antagonistic rhythms and divergent systems of accentuation in a
    single piece. They assigned these several ingredients to several parts; and for the
    further exhibition of their perverse skill, went even to the length of coupling
    themes in the major and the minor.</p>
    <p>The most obvious result of such practice was that it became impossible to
    understand what words were being sung, and that instead of concord and order in the
    choir, a confused discord and anarchy of dinning sounds prevailed. What made the
    matter from an ecclesiastical point of view still worse, was that these
    scholastically artificial compositions were frequently based on trivial and vulgar
    tunes, suggesting the tavern, the dancing-room, or even worse places, to worshipers
    assembled for the celebration of a Sacrament. Masses bore titles adopted from the
    popular melodies on which they were founded: such, for example, as 'Adieu mes
    amours,' 'A l'ombre d'un buissonnet,' 'Baise-moi,' 'L'ami baudichon madame,' 'Le
    vilain jaloux.' Even the words of love-ditties and obscene ballads in French,
    Flemish, and Italian, were being squalled out by the tenor while the bass gave
    utterance to an <i>Agnus</i> or a <i>Benedictus</i>, and the soprano was engaged upon
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> verses of a
    Latin hymn. Baini, who examined hundreds of these Masses and motetts in MS., says
    that the words imported into them from vulgar sources 'make one's flesh creep and
    one's hair stand on end.' He does not venture to do more than indicate a few of the
    more decent of these interloping verses; but mentions one <i>Kyrie</i>, in which the
    tenor sang <i>Je ne vis oncques la pareille</i>; a <i>Sanctus</i>, in which he had to
    utter <i>gracieuse gente mounyere</i>; and a <i>Benedictus</i>, where the same
    offender was employed on <i>Madame, faites moy s&ccedil;avoir</i>. As an augmentation
    of this indecency, numbers from a Mass or motett which started with the grave rhythm
    of a Gregorian tone, were brought to their conclusion on the dance measure of a
    popular <i>ballata</i>, so that <i>Incarnatus est</i> or <i>Kyrie eleison</i> went
    jigging off into suggestions of Masetto and Zerlina at a village ball.</p>
    <p>To describe all the impertinences to which the customs of vocal execution then in
    vogue gave rise, by means of flourishes, improvisations, accelerations of time and
    multitudinous artifices derived from the <i>ad libitum</i> abuses of the fugal
    machinery, would serve no purpose. But it may be profitably mentioned that the
    mischief was not confined to the vocal parts. Organ and orchestra of divers
    instruments were allowed the same liberty of improvising on the given theme,
    embroidering these with fanciful <i>capricci</i>, and indulging their own taste in
    symphonies connected with the main structure by slight and artificial links.
    Instrumental music had not yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page320"
    id="page320"></a>{320}</span> taken an independent place in art. The lute, the
    trumpet, or the stops of the organ, followed and imitated the voice; and thus in this
    confusion a choir of stringed and wind instruments was placed in competition with the
    singing choir.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> It would appear that the composer
    frequently gave but a ground-sketch of his plan, without troubling himself to
    distribute written parts to the executants. The efflorescences, excursuses and
    episodes to which I have alluded, were supplied by artists whom long training in this
    kind of music enabled to perform their separate sallies and to execute their several
    antics within certain limits of recognized license. But since each vied with the
    other to produce striking effects, the choir rivaling the orchestra, the tenor
    competing with the bass, the organ with the viol, it followed that the din of their
    accumulated efforts was not unjustly compared to that made by a 'sty of grunting
    pigs,' the builders of the Tower of Babel, or the 'squalling of cats in January.'<a
    name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206"
    class="fnanchor">[206]</a> 'All their happiness,' writes a contemporary critic,
    'consisted in keeping the bass singer to the fugue, while at the same time one voice
    was shouting out <i>Sanctus</i>, another <i>Sabaoth</i>, a third <i>gloria tua</i>,
    with howlings, bellowings and squealings that cannot be described.'<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>{321}</span></p>
    <p>It must not be thought that this almost unimaginable state of things indicated a
    defect either of intellectual capacity or of artistic skill. It was due rather to the
    abuse of science and of virtuosity, both of which had attained to a high degree of
    development. It manifested the decadence of music in its immaturity, through
    over-confident employment of exuberant resources on an end inadequate for the
    fulfillment of the art. Music, it must be remembered, unlike literature and plastic
    art, had no antique tradition to assimilate, no masterpieces of accomplished form to
    study. In the modern world it was an art without connecting links to bind it to the
    past. And this circumstance rendered it liable to negligent treatment by a society
    that prided itself upon the recovery of the classics. The cultivated classes
    abandoned it in practice to popular creators of melody upon the one hand, and to
    grotesque scholastic pedants on the other. And from the blending of those
    ill-accorded elements arose the chaos which I have attempted to describe.</p>
    <p>Learned composers in the style developed by the Flemish masters had grown tired of
    writing simple music for four voices and a single choir. They reveled in the
    opportunity of combining eight vocal parts and bringing three choirs with
    accompanying orchestras into play at the same time. They were proud of proving how by
    counterpoint the most dissimilar and mutually-jarring factors could be wrought into a
    whole, intelligible to the scientific <span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"
    id="page322"></a>{322}</span> musician, though unedifying to the public. In the
    neglect of their art, considered as an art of interpretation and expression, they
    abandoned themselves to intricate problems and to the presentation of incongruous
    complexities.</p>
    <p>The singers were expert in rendering difficult passages, in developing unpromising
    motives, and in embroidering the arras-work of the composer with fanciful
    extravagances of vocal execution. The instrumentalists were trained in the art of
    copying effects of fugue or madrigal by lutes and viols in concerted pieces. The
    people were used to dance and sing and touch the mandoline together; in every house
    were found amateurs who could with voice and string produce the studied compositions
    of the masters.</p>
    <p>What was really lacking, amid this exuberance of musical resources, in this thick
    jungle of technical facilities, was a controlling element of correct taste, a right
    sense of the proper function of music as an interpretative art. On the very threshold
    of its modern development, music had fallen into early decay owing to the
    misapplication of the means so copiously provided by nature and by exercise. A man of
    genius and of substantial intuition into the real ends of vocal music was demanded at
    this moment, who should guide the art into its destined channel. And in order to
    elicit such a creator of new impulses, such a Nomothetes of the disordered state, it
    was requisite that external pressure should <span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"
    id="page323"></a>{323}</span> be brought to bear upon the art. An initiator of the
    right caliber was found in Palestrina. The pressure from without was supplied by the
    Council of Trent.</p>
    <p>It may here be parenthetically remarked that music, all through modern history,
    has needed such legislators and initiators of new methods. Considered as an art of
    expression, she has always tended to elude control, to create for herself a domain
    extraneous to her proper function, and to erect her resources of mere sound into
    self-sufficingness. What Palestrina effected in the sixteenth century, was afterwards
    accomplished on a wider platform by Gluck in the eighteenth, and in our own days the
    same deliverance has been attempted by Wagner. The efforts of all these epoch-making
    musicians have been directed toward restraining the tendencies of music to assert an
    independence, which for herself becomes the source of weakness by reducing her to
    co-operation with insignificant words, and which renders her subservient to merely
    technical dexterities.</p>
    <p>Giovanni Pier Luigi, called Palestrina from his birthplace in one of the Colonna
    fiefs near Rome, the ancient Praeneste, was born of poor parents, in the year 1524,
    He went to Rome about 1540, and began his musical career probably as a choir-boy in
    one of the Basilicas. Claude Goudimel, the Besan&ccedil;on composer, who subsequently
    met a tragic death at Lyons in a massacre of Huguenots, had <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page324" id="page324"></a>{324}</span> opened a school of harmony in Rome,
    where Palestrina learned the first rudiments of that science. What Palestrina owed to
    Goudimel, is not clear. But we have the right to assume that the Protestant
    part-songs of the French people which Goudimel transferred to the hymn-books of the
    Huguenots, had a potent influence upon the formation of his style. They may have been
    for him what the Chorales of Germany were for the school of Bach.<a
    name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207"
    class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Externally, Palestrina's life was a very uneventful one,
    and the records collected with indefatigable diligence by his biographer have only
    brought to light changes from one post to another in several Basilicas, and unceasing
    industry in composition. The vast number of works published by Palestrina in his
    lifetime, or left in MS. at his death, or known to have been written and now lost,
    would be truly astonishing were it not a fact that very eminent creative genius is
    always copious, and in no province of the arts more fertile than in that of music.
    Palestrina lived and died a poor man. In his dedications he occasionally remarks with
    sober pathos on the difficulty of pursuing scientific studies in the midst of
    domestic anxiety. His pay was very small, and the expense of publishing his works,
    which does not seem to have been defrayed by patrons, was at that time very great.
    Yet he enjoyed an uncontested reputa<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"
    id="page325"></a>{325}</span> tion as the first of living composers, the saviour of
    Church music, the creator of a new style; and on his tomb, in 1594, was inscribed
    this title: <i>Princeps Musicae</i>.</p>
    <p>The state of confusion into which ecclesiastical music had fallen, rendered it
    inevitable that some notice of so grave a scandal should be taken by the Fathers of
    the Tridentine Council in their deliberations on reform of ritual. It appears,
    therefore, that in their twenty-second session (September 17, 1562) they enjoined
    upon the Ordinaries to 'exclude from churches all such music as, whether through the
    organ or the singing, introduces anything of impure or lascivious, in order that the
    house of God may truly be seen to be and may be called the house of prayer.'<a
    name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208"
    class="fnanchor">[208]</a> In order to give effect to this decree of the Tridentine
    Council, Pius IV. appointed a congregation of eight Cardinals upon August 2, 1564,
    among whom three deserve especial mention&mdash;Michele Ghislieri, the Inquisitor,
    who was afterwards Pope Pius V.; Carlo Borromeo, the sainted Archbishop of Milan; and
    Vitellozzo Vitellozzi. It was their business, among other matters of reform, to see
    that the Church music of Rome was instantly reduced to proper order in accordance
    with the decree of the Council. Carlo Borromeo was nephew and chief minister of the
    reigning Pope. Vitellozzo Vitellozzi was a young man of thirty-three years, who
    possessed a singular passion for music.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id="page326"></a>{326}</span> To these two
    members of the congregation, as a sub-committee, was deputed the special task of
    settling the question of ecclesiastical music, it being stipulated that they should
    by all means see that sufficient clearness was introduced into the enunciation of the
    liturgical words by the singers.</p>
    <p>I will here interrupt the thread of the narration, in order to touch upon the
    legendary story which connects Palestrina incorrectly with what subsequently
    happened. It was well known that on the decisions of the sub-committee of the
    congregation hung the fate of Church music. For some while it seemed as though music
    might be altogether expelled from the rites of the Catholic Ecclesia. And it soon
    became matter of history that Palestrina had won the cause of his art, had maintained
    it in its eminent position in the ritual of Rome, and at the same time had opened a
    new period in the development of modern music by the production of his Mass called
    the <i>Mass of Pope Marcellus</i> at this critical moment. These things were true;
    and when the peril had been overpassed, and the actual circumstances of the salvation
    and revolution of Church music had been forgotten, the memory of the crisis and the
    title of the victorious Mass remained to form a mythus. The story ran that the good
    Pope Marcellus, who occupied the Holy See for only twenty-two days, in the year 1555,
    determined on the abolition of all music but Plain Song in the Church; hearing of
    which resolve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id="page327"></a>{327}</span>
    Palestrina besought him to suspend his decree until he had himself produced and
    presented a Mass conformable to ecclesiastical propriety. Marcello granted the
    chapel-master this request; and on Easter Day, the Mass, which saved Church music
    from destruction, was performed with the papal approval and the applause of Rome. It
    is not necessary to point out the many impossibilities and contradictions involved in
    this legend, since the real history of the Mass which wrought salvation for Church
    music, lies before us plainly written in the prolix pages of Baini. Yet it would have
    vexed me to pass by in silence so interesting and instructive an example of the mode
    by which the truth of history is veiled in legend.</p>
    <p>Truth is always more interesting than fiction, and the facts of this important
    episode in musical history are not without their element of romance. There is no
    doubt that there was a powerful party in the Catholic Church imbued with a stern
    ascetic or puritanical spirit, who would gladly have excluded all but Plain Song from
    her services. Had Michele Ghislieri instead of the somewhat worldly Angelo de'Medici
    been on the Papal throne, or had the decision of the musical difficulty been
    delegated to him by the congregation of eight Cardinals in 1564, Palestrina might not
    have obtained that opportunity of which he so triumphantly availed himself. But it
    happened that the reigning Pope was a lover of the art, and had a special reason for
    being almost <span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id="page328"></a>{328}</span>
    superstitiously indulgent to its professors. While he was yet a Cardinal, in the
    easy-going days of Julius III., Angelo de'Medici had been invited with other princes
    of the Church to hear the marvelous performances upon the lute and the incomparable
    improvisations of a boy called Silvio Antoniano. The meeting took place at a banquet
    in the palace of the Venetian Cardinal Pisani. When the guests were assembled, the
    Cardinal Rannuccio Farnese put together a bouquet of flowers, and presenting these to
    the musician, bade him give them to that one of the Cardinals who should one day be
    chosen Pope. Silvio without hesitation handed the flowers to Angelo de'Medici, and
    taking up his lute began to sing his praises in impassioned extempore verse. After
    his election to the Papacy, with the title of Pius IV., Angelo de'Medici took Silvio
    into his service, and employed him in such honorable offices that the fortunate youth
    was finally advanced to the dignity of Cardinal under the reign of Clement VIII., in
    1598.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209"
    class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>
    <p>It was therefore necessary for the congregation of musical reform to take the
    Pope's partiality for this art into consideration; and they showed their good will by
    choosing his own nephew, together with a notorious amateur of music, for their
    sub-committee. The two Cardinals applied to the College of Pontifical Singers for
    advice; and these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"
    id="page329"></a>{329}</span> deputed eight of their number&mdash;three Spaniards,
    one Fleming, and four Italians&mdash;to act as assistants in the coming
    deliberations. It was soon agreed that Masses and motetts in which different verbal
    themes were jumbled, should be prohibited; that musical motives taken from profane
    songs should be abandoned; and that no countenance should be given to compositions or
    words invented by contemporary poets. These three conditions were probably laid down
    as indispensable by the Cardinals in office before proceeding to the more difficult
    question of securing a plain and intelligible enunciation of the sacred text. When
    the Cardinals demanded this as the essential point in the proposed reform, the
    singers replied that it would be impossible in practice. They were so used to the
    complicated structure of figured music, with its canons, fugal intricacies,
    imitations and inversions, that they could not even imagine a music that should be
    simple and straightforward, retaining the essential features of vocal harmony, and
    yet allowing the words on which it was composed to be distinctly heard. The Cardinals
    rebutted these objections by pointing to the Te Deum of Costanzo Festa (a piece which
    has been always sung on the election of a new Pope from that day to our own times)
    and to the Improperia of Palestrina, which also holds its own in the service of the
    Sistine. But the singers answered that these were exceptional pieces, which, though
    they might fulfill the requirements of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"
    id="page330"></a>{330}</span> Congregation of Reform, could not be taken as the sole
    models for compositions involving such variety and length of execution as the Mass.
    Their answer proved conclusively to what extent the contrapuntal style had
    dissociated itself from the right object of all vocal music, that of interpreting,
    enforcing, and transfiguring the words with which it deals, and how it had become a
    mere art for the scientific development of irrelevant and often impertinent melodic
    themes.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid an absolute deadlock, which might have resulted in the sacrifice
    of ecclesiastical harmony, and have inflicted a death-blow on modern music, the
    committee agreed to refer their difficulties to Palestrina. On the principle of
    <i>solvitur ambulando</i>, he was invited to study the problem, and to produce a
    trial piece which should satisfy the conditions exacted by the Congregation as well
    as the requirements of the artists. Literally, he received commission to write a Mass
    in sober ecclesiastical style, free from all impure and light suggestions in the
    themes, the melodies and the rhythms, which should allow the sacred words in their
    full sense to be distinctly heard, without sacrificing vocal harmony and the
    customary interlacing of fugued passages. If he succeeded, the Cardinals promised to
    make no further innovation; but if he failed, Carlo Borromeo warned him that the
    Congregation of Reform would disband the choral establishments of the Pontifical
    Chapel and the Ro<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"
    id="page331"></a>{331}</span> man churches, and prohibit the figured style in vogue,
    in pursuance of the clear decision of the Tridentine Council.</p>
    <p>This was a task of Hercules imposed on Palestrina. The art to which he had devoted
    his lifetime, the fame which he had acquired as a composer, the profession by which
    he and all his colleagues gained their daily bread, depended on his working out the
    problem. He was practically commanded to discover a new species of Church music, or
    to behold the ruin of himself and his companions, the extinction of the art and
    science he so passionately loved. Truly may his biographer remark: 'I am deliberately
    of opinion that no artist either before or since has ever found himself in a parallel
    strait.'</p>
    <p>We have no exact record of the spirit in which he approached this labor.<a
    name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210"
    class="fnanchor">[210]</a> But he was a man of sincere piety, a great and
    enthusiastic servant of art. The command he had received came from a quarter which at
    that period and in Rome had almost divine authority. He knew that music hung
    trembling in the balance upon his failure or success.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>{332}</span> And these
    two motives, the motive of religious zeal and the motive of devotion to art, inspired
    him for the creation of a new musical world. Analysis of his work and comparison of
    it with the style which he was called on to supersede, show pretty clearly what were
    the principles that governed him. With a view to securing the main object of
    rendering the text intelligible to the faithful, he had to dispense with the
    complicated Flemish system of combined melodies in counterpoint, and to employ his
    scientific resources of fugue and canon with parsimony, so that in future they should
    subserve and not tyrannize over expression. He determined to write for six voices,
    two of which should be bass, in order that the fundamental themes should be sustained
    with dignity and continuity. But what he had principally in view, what in fact he had
    been called on to initiate, was that novel adaptation of melody and science to verbal
    phrase and sense, whereby music should be made an art interpretative of religious
    sentiment, powerful to clothe each shade of meaning in the text with appropriate and
    beautiful sound, instead of remaining a merely artificial and mechanical structure of
    sounds disconnected from the words employed in giving them vocal utterance.</p>
    <p>Palestrina set to work, and composed three Masses, which were performed upon April
    28, 1565, before the eight Cardinals of the congregation in the palace of Cardinal
    Vitellozzi. All three were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"
    id="page333"></a>{333}</span> approved of; but the first two still left something to
    be desired. Baini reports that they preserved somewhat too much of the cumbrous
    Flemish manner; and that though the words were more intelligible, the fugal artifices
    overlaid their clear enunciation. In the third, however, it was unanimously agreed
    that Palestrina had solved the problem satisfactorily. 'Its style is always equal,
    always noble, always alive, always full of thought and sincere feeling, rising and
    ascending to the climax; not to understand the words would be impossible; the
    melodies combine to stimulate devotion; the harmonies touch the heart; it delights
    without distracting; satisfies desire without tickling the senses; it is beautiful in
    all the beauties of the sanctuary.' So writes Palestrina's enthusiastic biographer;
    so apparently thought the Cardinals of the congregation; and when this Mass (called
    the <i>Mass of Pope Marcellus</i>, out of grateful tribute to the Pontiff, whose
    untimely death had extinguished many sanguine expectations) was given to the world,
    the whole of Italy welcomed it with a burst of passionate applause. Church music had
    been saved. Modern music had been created. A new and lovely-form of art had arisen
    like a star.</p>
    <p>It was not enough that the <i>Mass of Pope Marcellus</i> should have satisfied the
    congregation. It had next to receive the approval of the Pope, who heard it on June
    19. On this occasion, if the Court Chronicle be correct, Pius made a pretty speech,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>{334}</span> declaring that
    'of such nature must have been the harmonies of the new song heard by John the
    Apostle in the heavenly Jerusalem, and that another John had given us a taste of them
    in the Jerusalem of the Church Militant.' He seems, indeed, to have been convinced
    that the main problem of preserving clearness of enunciation in the uttered words had
    been solved, and that there was now no reason to deprive the faithful of the artistic
    and devotional value of melodious music. He consequently appointed Palestrina to the
    post of composer for the Papal Chapel, and created a monopoly for the performance of
    his works. This measure, which roused considerable jealousy among musicians at the
    moment, had the salutary effect of rendering the new style permanent in usage.</p>
    <p>Of Palestrina's voluminous compositions this is not the place to speak. It is
    enough to have indicated the decisive part which he took in the reformation of Church
    music at a moment when its very existence was imperiled, and to have described the
    principles upon which he laid down new laws for the art. I must not, however, omit to
    dwell upon his subsequent connection with S. Filippo Neri, since the music he
    composed for the Oratory of that saint contributed much toward the creation of a
    semi-lyrical and semi-dramatic style to which we may refer the origins of the modern
    Oratorio. Filippo Neri was the spiritual director of Palestrina, and appointed him
    composer to his devout confraternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page335"
    id="page335"></a>{335}</span> For the use of that society the master wrote a series
    of <i>Arie Divote</i> on Italian words. They were meant to be sung by the members,
    and to supersede the old usages of Laud-music, which had chiefly consisted in
    adapting popular street-tunes to sacred words.<a name="FNanchor_211_211"
    id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>
    <p>To the same connection with the Oratory we owe one of the most remarkable series
    of Palestrina's compositions. These were written upon the words of an Italian Canzone
    in thirty octave stanzas, addressed as a prayer to the Virgin. Palestrina set each
    stanza, after the fashion of a Madrigal, to different melodies; and the whole work
    proved a manual of devotional music, in the purest artistic taste, and the most
    delicately sentimental key of feeling. Together with this collection of spiritual
    songs should be mentioned Palestrina's setting of passages from the Song of Solomon
    in a series of motetts; which were dedicated to Gregory XIII., in 1584. They had an
    enormous success. Ten editions between that date and 1650 were poured out from the
    presses of Rome and Venice, to satisfy the impatience of thousands who desired to
    feed upon 'the nectar of their sweetness.' Palestrina chose for the motives of his
    compositions such voluptuous phrases of the Vulgate as the following: <i>Fasciculus
    myrrhae dilectus meus mihi.</i> <i>Fulcite me floribus, stipate me malis, quia amore
    langueo.</i> <i>Vulnerasti cor meum, soror, sponsa mea.</i> This was the period <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>{336}</span> when Italy was
    ringing with the secular sweetnesses of Tasso's <i>Aminta</i> and of Guarini's
    <i>Pastor fido</i>; when the devotion of the cloister was becoming languorous and
    soft; when the cult of the Virgin was assuming the extravagant proportions satirized
    by Pascal; finally, when manners were affecting a tone of swooning piety blent with
    sensuous luxuriousness. Palestrina's setting of the Canticle and of the Hymn to Mary
    provided the public with music which, according to the taste of that epoch,
    transferred terrestrial emotions into the regions of paradisal bliss, and justified
    the definition of music as the <i>Lamento dell'amore o la preghiera agli dei</i>. The
    great creator of a new ecclesiastical style, the 'imitator of nature,' as Vincenzo
    Galilei styled him, the 'prince of music,' as his epitaph proclaimed him, lent his
    genius to an art, vacillating between mundane sensuality and celestial rapture,
    which, however innocently developed by him in the sphere of music, was symptomatic of
    the most unhealthy tendencies of his race and age. While singing these madrigals and
    these motetts the youth of either sex were no longer reminded, it is true, of tavern
    ditties or dance measures. But the emotions of luxurious delight or passionate
    ecstasy deep in their own natures were drawn forth, and sanctified by application to
    the language of effeminate devotion.</p>
    <p>I have dwelt upon these two sets of compositions, rather than upon the masses of
    strictly and severely <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"
    id="page337"></a>{337}</span> ecclesiastical music which Palestrina produced with
    inexhaustible industry, partly because they appear to have been extraordinarily
    popular, and partly because they illustrate those tendencies in art and manners which
    the sentimental school of Bolognese painters attempted to embody. They belong to that
    religious sphere which the Jesuit Order occupied, governed, and administered upon the
    lines of their prescribed discipline. These considerations are not merely irrelevant.
    The specific qualities of Italian music for the next two centuries were undoubtedly
    determined by the atmosphere of sensuous pietism in which it flourished, at the very
    time when German music was striking far other roots in the Chorales of the
    Reformation epoch. What Palestrina effected was to substitute in Church music the
    clear and melodious manner of the secular madrigal for the heavy and scholastic
    science of the Flemish school, and to produce masterpieces of religious art in his
    motetts on the Canticles which confounded the lines of demarcation between pious and
    profane expression. He taught music to utter the emotions of the heart; but those
    emotions in his land and race were already tending in religion toward the sentimental
    and voluptuous.</p>
    <p>There is no doubt that the peril to which music was exposed at the time of the
    Tridentine Council was a serious and real one. When we remember how intimate was the
    connection between the higher kinds of music and the ritual of the Church, this <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>{338}</span> will be apparent. Nor
    is it too much to affirm that the art at that crisis, but for the favor shown to it
    by Pius IV. and for Palestrina's intervention, might have been well-nigh extinguished
    in Italy. How fatal the results would then have been for the development of modern
    music, can be estimated by considering the decisive part played by the Italians in
    the formation of musical style from the end of the sixteenth century onwards to the
    age of Gluck, Handel, Haydn and Mozart. Had the music of the Church in Italy been
    confined at that epoch to Plain Song, as the Congregation of Reform threatened, the
    great Italian school of vocalization would not have been founded, the Conservatories
    of Naples and the Scuole of Venice would have been silent, and the style upon which,
    dating from Palestrina's inventions, the evolution of all species of the art
    proceeded, would have passed into oblivion.</p>
    <p>That this proposition is not extravagant, the history of music in England will
    suffice to prove. Before the victory of Puritan principles in Church and State, the
    English were well abreast of other races in this art. During the sixteenth century,
    Tallis, Byrd, Morland, Wilbye, Dowland and Orlando Gibbons could hold their own
    against Italian masters. The musical establishments of cathedrals, royal and
    collegiate chapels, and noble houses were nurseries for artists. Every English home,
    in that age, like every German home in the eighteenth century, abounded in amateurs
    who were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span>
    capable of performing part-songs and concerted pieces on the lute and viol with
    correctness. Under the <i>r&eacute;gime</i> of the Commonwealth this national growth
    of music received a check from which it never afterwards recovered. Though the
    seventeenth century witnessed the rising of one eminent composer, Purcell; though the
    eighteenth was adorned with meritorious writers of the stamp of Blow and Boyce; yet
    it is obvious that the art remained among us unprogressive, at a time when it was
    making gigantic strides in Italy and Germany. It is always dangerous to attribute the
    decline of art in a nation to any one cause. Yet I think it can scarcely be contested
    that the change of manners and of temperament wrought in England by the prevalence of
    Puritan opinion, had much to answer for in this premature decay of music. We may
    therefore fairly argue that if the gloomy passion of intolerant fanaticism which
    burned in men like Caraffa and Ghislieri had prevailed in Italy&mdash;a passion
    analogous in its exclusiveness to Puritanism&mdash;or if no composer, in the place of
    Palestrina, had satisfied the requirements of the Council and the congregation, the
    history of music in Italy and Europe to us-wards would have been far different.</p>
    <p>These considerations are adduced to justify the importance attached by me to the
    episode of which Palestrina was the hero. Yet it should not be forgotten that other
    influences were at work at the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"
    id="page340"></a>{340}</span> same time in Italy, which greatly stimulated the
    advance of music. If space permitted, it would be interesting to enlarge upon the
    work of Luca Marenzio, the prince of madrigal-writers, and on the services rendered
    by Vincenzo Galileo, father of the greatest man of science in his age, in placing the
    practice of stringed instruments on a sound basis. It should also be remembered that
    in the society of Filippo Neri at Rome, the Oratorio was taking shape, and emerging
    from the simple elements of the Spiritual Laud and <i>Aria Divota</i>. This form,
    however, would certainly have perished if the austere party in the Church had
    prevailed against the lenient for the exclusion of figured music, from religious
    exercises.</p>
    <p>There was, moreover, an interesting contemporary movement at Florence, which
    deserves some detailed mention. A private academy of amateurs and artists formed
    itself for the avowed purpose of reviving the musical declamation of the Greeks. As
    the new ecclesiastical style created by Palestrina grew out of the
    Counter-Reformation embodied in the decrees of the Tridentine Council, so this
    movement, which eventually resulted in the Opera, attached itself to the earlier
    enthusiasms of the Classical Revival. The humanists had restored Latin poetry; the
    architects had perfected a neo-Latin manner; sculptors and painters had profited by
    the study of antique fragments, and had reproduced the <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page341" id="page341"></a>{341}</span> bas-reliefs and arabesques of Roman
    palaces. It was now, much later in the day, the turn of the musicians to make a
    similar attempt. Their quest was vague and visionary. Nothing remained of Greek or
    Roman music. To guide these explorers, there was only a dim instinct that the
    ancients had declaimed dramatic verse with musical intonation. But, as the alchemists
    sought the philosopher's stone, and founded modern chemistry; as, according to an
    ancient proverb, they who search for silver find gold; so it happened that, from the
    pedantic and ill-directed attempts of this academy proceeded the system on which the
    modern Oratorio and Opera were based. What is noticeable in these experiments is,
    that a new form of musical expression, declamatory and continuous, therefore
    dramatic, as opposed to the lyrical and fugal methods of the contrapuntists, was in
    process of elaboration. Claudio Monteverde, who may be termed the pioneer of
    <i>recitativo</i>, in his opera of <i>Orfeo</i>; Giacomo Carissimi, in whose
    <i>Jephtha</i> the form of the Oratorio it already outlined, were the most eminent
    masters of the school which took its origin in the Florentine Academy of the Palazzo
    Vernio.</p>
    <p>To pursue the subject further, would be to transgress the chronological limits of
    my subject. It is enough to have attempted in this chapter to show how the destinies
    of Italian music were secured and its species determined in the last quarter of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>{342}</span> sixteenth
    century. How that art at its climax in the eighteenth century affected the manners,
    penetrated the whole life, and influenced the literature of the Italians, may be read
    in an English work of singular ability and originality.<a name="FNanchor_212_212"

    </div>
    <p>After tracing the origin of modern music at its fountain head in Palestrina, it
    requires some courage to approach the plastic arts at this same epoch.</p>
    <p>Music was the last real manifestation of the creative genius in Italy. Rarefied to
    evanescent currents of emotional and sensuous out-breathings, the spirit of the race
    exhaled itself in song from human throats, in melody on lute and viol, until the
    whole of Europe thrilled with the marvel and the mystery of this new language of the
    soul. Music was the fittest utterance for the Italians of the Counter-Reformation
    period. Debarred from political activity, denied the liberty of thought and speech,
    that gifted people found an inarticulate vehicle of expression in tone; tone which
    conveys all mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>{344}</span>
    ings to the nerves that feel, advances nothing to the mind that reasons, says
    everything without formulating a proposition.</p>
    <p>Only a sense of duty to my subject, which demands completion, makes me treat of
    painting in the last years of the sixteenth century. The great Italian cycle, rounded
    by Lionardo, Raffaello, Michelangelo, Correggio and Tiziano, was being closed at
    Venice by Tintoretto. After him invention ceased. But there arose at Bologna a
    school, bent on resuscitating the traditions of an art which had already done its
    utmost to interpret mind to mind through mediums of lovely form and color. The
    founders of the Bolognese Academy, like Medea operating on decrepit Aeson, chopped up
    the limbs of painting which had ceased to throb with organic life, recombined them by
    an act of intellect and will, and having pieced them together, set the composite
    machine in motion on the path of studied method. Their aim was analogous to that of
    the Church in its reconstitution of Catholicism; and they succeeded, in so far as
    they achieved a partial success, through the inspiration which the Catholic Revival
    gave them. These painters are known as the Eclectics and this title sufficiently
    indicates their effort to revive art by recomposing what lay before them in
    disintegrated fragments. They did not explore new territory or invent fresh vehicles
    of expression. They sought to select the best points of Graeco-Roman and Italian
    style, unconscious that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"
    id="page345"></a>{345}</span> the physical type of the Niobids, the voluptuous charm
    of Correggio, the luminous color of Titian, the terribleness of Michelangelo, and the
    serenity of Raphael, being the ultimate expressions of distinct artistic qualities,
    were incompatible. A still deeper truth escaped their notice&mdash;namely, that art
    is valueless unless the artist has something intensely felt to say, and that where
    this intensity of feeling exists, it finds for itself its own specific and inevitable
    form.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>These profound sentences are the epitaph, not only of imitative poetry, but also
    of such eclectic art as the Caracci instituted. Very little of it bears examination
    now. We regard it with listlessness or loathing. We turn from it without regret. We
    cannot, or do not, wish to keep it in our memory.</p>
    <p>Yet no student of Italian painting will refuse the Caracci that tribute of respect
    which is due to virile effort. They were in vital sympathy with the critical and
    analytical spirit of their age&mdash;an age mournfully conscious that its scepter had
    departed&mdash;that</p>

    <p>an age incapable as yet of acquiescing in this gloom, strenuously eager by study
    and by labor to regain <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"
    id="page346"></a>{346}</span> the kingdom which belongs alone to inspiration. Science
    and industry enabled them to galvanize the corpse of art; into this they breathed the
    breath of the religion <i>&agrave; la mode</i>, of fashionable sensuousness and
    prevalent sentimentality.</p>
    <p>Michelangelo died in 1564, Paolo Veronese in 1588, Tintoretto in 1594. These were
    the three latest survivors of the great generation, and each of them had enjoyed a
    life of activity prolonged into extreme old age. Their intellectual peers had long
    ago departed; Lionardo in 1520, Raphael in 1522, Correggio in 1534.</p>

        <span>'Theirs was the giant race, before the flood.'<br />
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>These dates have to be kept in mind; for the painters of the Bolognese School were
    all born after 1550, born for the most part at that decisive epoch of the Tridentine
    Council which might be compared to a watershed of time between the Renaissance and
    the Counter-Reformation&mdash;Lodovico Caracci in 1555, Agostino in 1558, Annibale in
    1560, Guido Reni in 1574, Lionello Spada in 1576, Francesco Albani in 1578,
    Domenichino in 1581, Guercino in 1590.<a name="FNanchor_213_213"
    id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> With
    the last of these men the eclectic impulse was exhausted; and a second generation,
    derived in part from them, linked the painters of the Renaissance <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id="page347"></a>{347}</span> to those of modern
    times. It is sufficient to mention Nicholas and Gaspar Poussin, Claude Lorraine,
    Salvator Rosa, Luca Giordano, and Canaletto as chief representatives of this
    secondary group.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>
    <p>On examining the dates which I have given, it will be noticed that the Bolognese
    Eclectics, intervening between the age of Michelangelo and the age of Nicholas
    Poussin, worked during the first fervor of the Catholic Revival. Their art may
    therefore be taken as fairly representative of the religious temper and the profane
    culture of the Italians in the period influenced by the Council of Trent. It
    represents that temper and that culture before the decline of the same influence,
    when the Counter Reformation was in active progress and the Papal pretensions to
    absolute dominion had received no check.</p>
    <p>We should be wrong, however, to treat the Eclectics as though they succeeded
    without interruption to that 'giant race, before the flood.' Their movement was
    emphatically one of revival; and revival implies decadence. After 1541, when
    Michelangelo finished the Last Judgment, and before 1584, when the Caracci were
    working on their frescoes in the Palazzo Fava at Bologna&mdash;that is to say,
    between the last of the genuine Renaissance paintings and the first of the
    Revival&mdash;nearly half a century elapsed, during which art sank into a <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id="page348"></a>{348}</span> slough of slovenly
    and soulless putrescence.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Every city of Italy swarmed with
    artists, adequately educated in technical methods, and apt at aping the grand style
    of their masters. But in all their work there is nothing felt, nothing thought out,
    nothing expressed, nothing imagined. It is a vast vacuity of meaningless and
    worthless brush-play, a wilderness of hollow trickery and futile fumbling with
    conventional forms. The Mannerists, as they were called, covered acres of palace and
    church walls with allegories, histories, and legends, carelessly designed, rapidly
    executed, but pleasing the eye with crowds of figures and with gaudy colors. Their
    colors are now faded. Their figures are now seen to be reminiscences of Raphael's,
    Correggio's, Buonarroti's draughtsmanship. Yet they satisfied the patrons of that
    time, who required hasty work, and had not much money wherewith to reward the mature
    labors of a conscientious student. In relation, moreover, to the spiritless and
    insincere architecture then coming into vogue, this art of the Mannerists can
    scarcely be judged out of place. When I divulge the names of Giorgio Vasari, Giuseppe
    Cesari (Cav. d'Arpino), Tempesta, Fontana, Tibaldi, the Zuccari, the Procaccini, the
    Campi of Cremona, the scholars of Perino del Vaga, I shall probably call up before
    the reluctant eyes of many of my readers visions of dreary wanderings through
    weariful saloons <span class="pagenum"><a name="page349"
    id="page349"></a>{349}</span> and of disconsolate starings up at stuccoed cupolas in
    Rome and Genoa, in Florence and Naples, and in all the towns of Lombardy.<a
    name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216"
    class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>
    <p>In an earlier volume I briefly sketched the development of this pernicious
    mannerism, which now deluged the arts of Italy. Only one painter, outside Venice,
    seems to have carried on a fairly good tradition. This was Federigo Baroccio
    (1528-1612), who feebly continued the style of Correggio, with a certain hectic
    originality, infusing sentimental pietism into that great master's pagan
    sensuousness. The mixture is disagreeable; and when one is obliged to mention
    Baroccio as the best in a bad period, this accentuates the badness of his
    contemporaries. He has however, historical value from another point of view, inasmuch
    as nothing more strongly characterizes the eclecticism of the Caracci than their
    partiality for Correggio.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Though I have no reason to
    suppose that Baroccio, living chiefly as he did at Urbino, directly influenced their
    style, the similarity between his ideal and theirs is certainly striking. It seems to
    point at something inevitable in the direction taken by the Eclectics.</p>
    <p>Such was the state of art in Italy when Lodovico Caracci, the son of a Bolognese
    butcher, conceived <span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"
    id="page350"></a>{350}</span> his plan of replacing it upon a sounder system.<a
    name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218"
    class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Instinct led him to Venice, where painting was still
    alive. The veteran Tintoretto warned him that he had no vocation. But Lodovico
    obstinately resolved to win by industry what nature seemed to have denied him. He
    studied diligently at Florence, Parma, Mantua, and Venice, founding his style upon
    those of Andrea del Sarto, Correggio, Titian, Parmigiano, Giulio Romano, and
    Primaticcio. When he again settled at Bologna, he induced his two cousins, Agostino
    and Annibale, the sons of a tailor, to join him in the serious pursuit of art.
    Agostino was a goldsmith by trade, already expert in the use of the burin, which he
    afterwards employed more frequently than the brush.<a name="FNanchor_219_219"
    id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Of
    the three Caracci he was the most versatile, and perhaps the most gifted. There is a
    note of distinction and attainment in his work. Annibale, the youngest, was a rough,
    wild, hasty, and hot-tempered lad, of robust build and vigorous intellect, but
    boorish in his manners, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page351"
    id="page351"></a>{351}</span> fond of low society, and eaten up with jealousy. They
    called him the <i>ragazzaccio</i>, or 'lout of a boy,' when he began to make his mark
    at Bologna. Agostino presented a strong contrast to his brother, being an
    accomplished musician, an excellent dancer, a fair poet, fit to converse with
    noblemen, and possessed of very considerable culture. Lodovico, the eldest of the
    cousins, acted as mentor and instructor to the others. He pacified their quarrels,
    when Annibale's jealousy burst out; set them upon the right methods of study, and
    passed judgment on their paintings.</p>
    <p>Like Lodovico, the brothers served their first apprenticeship in art at Parma and
    Venice. Annibale's letters from the former place show how Correggio subdued him, and
    the large copies he there made still preserve for us some shadows of Correggio's
    time-ruined frescoes. At Venice he executed a copy of Titian's Peter Martyr. This
    picture, the most dramatic of Titian's works, and the most elaborate in its
    landscape, was destined to exercise a decisive influence over the Eclectic school.
    From the Caracci to Domenichino we are able to trace the dominant tone and
    composition of that masterpiece. No less decisive, as I have already observed, was
    the influence of Correggio's peculiar style in the choice of type, the light and
    shade, and the foreshortenings of the Bolognese painters. In some degree, the manner
    of Paolo Veronese may also be discerned. The Caracci avoided Tintoretto, and <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>{352}</span> at the beginning of
    their career they derived but little from Raphael or Michelangelo. Theirs was at
    first a mainly Veneto-Lombardic eclecticism, dashed with something absorbed from
    Giulio Romano and something from the later Florentines. It must not however, be
    supposed that they confined their attention to Italian painters. They contrived to
    collect casts from antique marbles, coins, engravings of the best German and Italian
    workmanship, books on architecture and perspective, original drawings, and similar
    academical appliances. Nor were they neglectful of drawing from the nude, or of
    anatomy. Indeed, their days and nights were spent in one continuous round of study,
    which had for its main object the comparison of dead and living nature with the best
    specimens of art in all ages. It may seem strange that this assiduity and
    thoroughness of method did not produce work of higher quality. Yet we must remember
    that even enthusiastic devotion to art will not give inspiration, and that the most
    thorough science cannot communicate charm. Though the Caracci invented fresh
    attitudes and showed complete mastery of the human form, their types remained
    commonplace. Though their chiaroscuro was accurately based on that of Correggio, it
    lacked his a&euml;rial play of semitones. Though they went straight to Titian for
    color, they never approached Venetian lucidity and glow. There was something vulgar
    in their imagination, prosaic in their feeling, leaden in their frigid touch on
    legend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353" id="page353"></a>{353}</span> Who
    wants those countless gods and goddesses of the Farnese Gallery, those beblubbered
    saints and colossal Sibyls of the Bolognese Pinacoteca, those chubby cherubs and
    buxom nymphs, those Satyrs and S. Sebastians, to come down from the walls and live
    with us? The grace of Raphael's Galatea, the inspiration of Michelangelo's Genii of
    the Sistine, the mystery of Lionardo's Faun-S. John, the wilding grace of Correggio's
    Diana, the voluptuous fascination of Titian's Venus, the mundane seductiveness of
    Veronese's Europa, the golden glory of Tintoretto's Bacchus,&mdash;all have
    evanesced, and in their place are hard mechanic figures, excellently drawn, correctly
    posed, but with no touch of poetry. Where, indeed, shall we find 'the light that
    never was on sea or land' throughout Bologna?<a name="FNanchor_220_220"
    id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>
    <p>Part of this failure must be ascribed to a radically false conception of the way
    to combine studies of nature with studies of art. The Eclectics in general started
    with the theory that a painter ought to form mental ideals of beauty, strength,
    dignity, ferocity, and so forth, from the observation of characteristic individuals
    and acknowledged master<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"
    id="page354"></a>{354}</span> pieces. These ideal types he has to preserve in his
    memory, and to use living persons only as external means for bringing them into play.
    Thus, it was indifferent who sat to him as model. He believed that he could invest
    the ugliest lump of living flesh with the loveliest fancy. Lodovico supplied Annibale
    Caracci with the fleshy back of a naked Venus. Guido Reni painted his Madonna's heads
    from any beardless pupil who came handy, and turned his deformed
    color-grinder&mdash;a man 'with a muzzle like a renegado'&mdash;into the penitent
    Magdalen.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> It was inevitable that forms and
    faces thus evolved should bear the stamp of mediocrity, monotony, and dullness on
    them. Few, very few, painters&mdash;perhaps only Michelangelo&mdash;have been able to
    give to purely imagined forms the value and the individuality of persons; and he
    succeeded best in this perilous attempt when he designed the passionate Genii of the
    Sistine frescoes. Such flights were far beyond the grasp of the Eclectics. Seeking
    after the 'grand style,' they fell, as I shall show in the sequel of this chapter,
    into commonplace vacuity, which makes them now insipid.<a name="FNanchor_222_222"
    id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a><span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>{355}</span></p>
    <p>There was at this time a native of Antwerp named Dionysius Calvaert, a coarse
    fellow of violent manners, who kept open school in Bologna. The best of the Caracci's
    pupils&mdash;Guido Reni, Domenichino and Albani&mdash;emigrated to their academy from
    this man's workshop. Something, as it seems to me, peculiar in the method of handling
    oil paint, which all three have in common, may perhaps be ascribed to early training
    under their Flemish master. His brutality drove them out of doors; and, having sought
    the protection of Lodovico Caracci, they successively made such progress in the
    methods of painting as rendered them the most distinguished representatives of the
    Bolognese Revival. All three were men of immaculate manners. Guido Reni, beautiful as
    a Sibyl in youth, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and fair complexion, was, to the end
    of his illustrious career, reputed a virgin. Albani, who translated into delicate
    oil-painting the sensuousness of the <i>Adone</i>, studied the forms of Nymphs and
    Venuses from his lovely wife, and the limbs of Amorini from the children whom she
    bore him regularly every year. Domenichino, a man of shy, retiring habits,
    preoccupied with the psychological problems which he strove to translate into
    dramatic pictures, doted on one woman, whom he married, and who lived to deplore his
    death (as she believed) by poison. Guido was specially characterized by devotion to
    Madonna. He was a singular child. On every Christmas eve, for seven successive years,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>{356}</span> ghostly
    knockings were heard upon his chamber door; and, every night, when he awoke from
    sleep, the darkness above his bed was illuminated by a mysterious egg-shaped globe of
    light.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> His eccentricity in later life
    amounted to insanity, and at last he gave himself up wholly to the demon of the
    gaming-table. Domenichino obeyed only one passion, if we except his passion for the
    wife he loved so dearly, and this was music. He displayed some strangeness of
    temperament in a morbid dislike of noise and interruptions. Otherwise, nothing
    disturbed the even current of an existence dedicated to solving questions of art.
    Albani mixed more freely in the world than Domenichino, enjoyed the pleasures of the
    table and of sumptuous living, but with Italian sobriety, and expatiated in those
    spheres of literature which supplied him with motives for his coldly sensual
    pictures. Yet he maintained the credit of a thoroughly domestic, soundly natured, and
    vigorously wholesome man.</p>
    <p>I have thought it well thus to preface what I have to say about these masters,
    partly because critics of the modern stamp, trusting more to their subjective
    impressions than to authoritative records, have painted the moral characters of Guido
    and Domenichino in lurid colors, and also because there is cer<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page357" id="page357"></a>{357}</span> tainly something in
    their work which leaves a painful memory of unhealthy sentiment, impassiveness to
    pain, and polished carnalism on the mind. It may incidentally be recorded that
    Lodovico Caracci, Guido Reni, and Francesco Albani are all of them, on very good
    authority, reported to have been even prudishly modest in their use of female models.
    They never permitted a woman to strip entirely, and Guido carried his reserve to such
    a pitch that he preferred to leave his studio door open while drawing from a woman.<a
    name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224"
    class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Malevolence might suggest that this was only part and
    parcel of post-Tridentine hypocrisy; and probably there is truth in the suggestion. I
    certainly do not reckon such solicitous respect for garments entirely to their
    credit. But it helps us to understand the eccentric compound of sentiment,
    sensuality, piety, and uneasy morality which distinguished the age, and which is
    continually perplexing the student of its art.</p>
    <p>Of these three men, Guido was the most genially endowed. He alone derived a true
    spark from the previous age of inspiration. He wearies us indeed with his effeminacy,
    and with the reiteration of a physical type sentimentalized from the head and bust of
    Niobe. But thoughts of real originality and grace not seldom visited his meditations;
    and he alone deserved the name of colorist among the <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page358" id="page358"></a>{358}</span> painters I have as yet ascribed to the
    Bolognese School.<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Guido affected a cool harmony of
    blue, white, and deadened gold, which in the best pictures of his second
    manner&mdash;the Fortune, the Bacchus and Ariadne of S. Luke's in Rome, the
    Crucifixion at Modena&mdash;has a charm akin to that of Metastasio's silvery lyrics.
    The samson at Bologna rises above these works both in force of conception and glow of
    color. The Aurora of the Rospigliosi Casino attempts a wider scheme of hues, and is
    certainly, except for some lack of refinement in the attendant Hours, a very noble
    composition. The S. Michael of the Cappuccini is seductive by its rich bravura style;
    and the large Piet&agrave; in the Bolognese Gallery impresses our mind by a
    monumental sadness and sobriety of tone. The Massacre of the Innocents, though one of
    Guido's most ambitious efforts, and though it displays an ingenious adaptation of the
    Niobe to Raphael's mannerism, fails by falling between two aims&mdash;the aim to
    secure dramatic effect, and the aim to treat a terrible subject with harmonious
    repose.</p>
    <p>Of Albani nothing need be said in detail. Most people knew his pictures of the
    Four Elements, so neatly executed in a style adapting Flemish smoothness of surface
    to Italian suavity of line. This sort of art delighted the cardinals and Monsignori
    of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>{359}</span>
    seventeenth century. But it has nothing whatsoever to say to and human soul.</p>
    <p>On Domenichino's two most famous pictures at Bologna Mr. Ruskin has written one of
    his over-poweringly virulent invectives.<a name="FNanchor_226_226"
    id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> It
    is worth inserting here at length. More passionate words could hardly be chosen to
    express the disgust inspired in minds attuned to earlier Italian art by these once
    worshiped paintings. Mr. Ruskin's obvious injustice, intemperance, and ostentatious
    emphasis will serve to point the change of opinion which has passed over England
    since Sir Joshua Reynolds wrote. His denunciation of the badness of Domenichino's
    art, though expressed with such a clangor of exaggeration, fairly represents the
    feeling of modern students. 'The man,' he says, 'who painted the Madonna del Rosario
    and Martyrdom of S. Agnes in the gallery of Bologna, is palpably incapable of doing
    anything good, great, or right in any field, way, or kind whatsoever.... This is no
    rash method of judgment, sweeping and hasty as it may appear. From the weaknesses of
    an artist, or failures, however numerous, we have no right to conjecture his total
    inability; a time may come when he shall rise into sudden strength, or an instance
    occur when his efforts shall be successful. But there are some pictures which rank
    not under the head of failures, but of perpetrations or commissions; some things
    which a man cannot do or say without seal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"
    id="page360"></a>{360}</span> ing forever his character and capacity. The angel
    holding the cross with his finger in his eye, the roaring, red-faced children about
    the crown of thorns, the blasphemous (I speak deliberately and determinedly) head of
    Christ upon the handkerchief, and the mode in which the martyrdom of the saint is
    exhibited (I do not choose to use the expressions which alone could characterize it),
    are perfect, sufficient, incontrovertible proofs that whatever appears good in any of
    the doings of such a painter must be deceptive, and that we may be assured that our
    taste is corrupted and false whenever we feel disposed to admire him. I am prepared
    to support this position, however uncharitable it may seem; a man may be tempted into
    a gross sin by passion, and forgiven; and yet there are some kinds of sins into which
    only men of a certain kind can be tempted, and which cannot be forgiven. It should be
    added, however, that the artistical qualities of these pictures are in every way
    worthy of the conceptions they realize. I do not recollect any instance of color or
    execution so coarse and feelingless.'</p>
    <p>We have only to think of the S. Agnes by Tintoretto, or of Luini's St. Catherine,
    in order to be well aware how far Domenichino, as a painter, deviated from the right
    path of art.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>{361}</span> Yet we are
    bound to acquit him, as a man, of that moral obliquity which Mr. Ruskin seems to
    impute. Indeed, we know Domenichino to have been an unaffectedly good fellow. He was
    misled by his dramatic bias, and also by the prevalent religious temper of his age.
    Jesuitry had saturated the Italian mind; and in a former chapter I have dwelt upon
    the concrete materialism which formed the basis of the Jesuitical imagination. In
    portraying the martyrdom of S. Agnes as he has done, Domenichino was only obeying the
    rules of Loyola's <i>Exercitia</i>. That he belonged to a school which was
    essentially vulgar in its choice of type, to a city never distinguished for delicacy
    of taste, and to a generation which was rapidly losing the sense of artistic reserve,
    suffices to explain the crude brutality of the conceptions which he formed of tragic
    episodes.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> The same may be said about all
    those horrible pictures of tortures, martyrdoms, and acts of violence which were
    produced by the dozen in Italy at this epoch. We turn from them with loathing. They
    inspire neither terror nor pity, only the sickness of the shambles. And yet it would
    be unjust to ascribe their unimaginative ghastliness to any special love of cruelty.
    This evil element may be rationally deduced from false dramatic instinct and
    perverted habits of brooding sensuously on our Lord's Passion, in minds deprived of
    the right feeling for artistic beauty.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>{362}</span> Probably
    Domenichino thought that he was surpassing Titian's Peter Martyr when he painted his
    hard and hideous parody of that great picture. Yet Titian had already touched the
    extreme verge of allowable realization, and his work belonged to the sphere of higher
    pictorial art mainly by right of noble treatment. Of this noble treatment, and of the
    harmonious coloring which shed a sanctifying splendor over the painful scene,
    Domenichino stripped his master's design. What he added was grimace, spasm, and the
    expression of degrading physical terror.</p>
    <p>That Domenichino could be, in his own way, stately, is proved by the Communion of
    S. Jerome, in which he rehandled Agostino Caracci's fine conception. Though devoid of
    charm, this justly celebrated painting remains a monument of the success which may be
    achieved by the vigorous application of robust intellectual powers to the working out
    of a well-conceived and fully developed composition. Domenichino's gigantic saints
    and Sibyls, with their fleshy limbs, red cheeks, and upturned eyes, though famous
    enough in the last century, do not demand a word of comment now.<a
    name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229"
    class="fnanchor">[229]</a> So strangely has taste altered, that to our eyes they seem
    scarcely decorative.</p>
    <p>While the Caracci were reviving art at Bologna in the way that I have described,
    Caravaggio in Rome opposed the Mannerists after his own and a <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id="page363"></a>{363}</span> very different
    fashion.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> The insipidities of men like
    Cesari drove him into a crude realism. He resolved to describe sacred and historical
    events just as though they were being enacted in the Ghetto by butchers and
    fishwives. This reaction against flimsy emptiness was wholesome; and many interesting
    studies from the taverns of Italy, portraits of gamesters, sharpers, <i>bravi</i> and
    the like, remain to prove Caravaggio's mastery over scenes of common life.<a
    name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231"
    class="fnanchor">[231]</a> But when he applied his principles to higher subjects,
    their vulgarity became apparent. Only in one picture, the Entombment in the Vatican,
    did he succeed in affecting imagination forcibly by the evident realization of a
    tragic scene. His martyrdoms are inexpressibly revolting, without appeal to any sense
    but savage blood-lust. It seems difficult for realism, either in literature or art,
    not to fasten upon ugliness, vice, pain, and disease, as though these imperfections
    of our nature were more real than beauty, goodness, pleasure, and health. Therefore
    Caravaggio, the leader of a school which the Italians christened Naturalists, may be
    compared to Zola.</p>
    <p>A Spaniard, settled at Naples&mdash;Giuseppe Ribera, nicknamed Lo
    Spagnoletto&mdash;carried on Caravaggio's tradition. Spagnoletto surpassed his master
    in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page364" id="page364"></a>{364}</span> the brutally
    realistic expression of physical anguish. His Prometheus writhing under the beak of
    the vulture, his disembowelled martyrs and skinless S. Bartholomews, are among the
    most nauseous products of a masculine nature blessed with robust health. Were they
    delirious or hysterical, they would be less disgusting. But no; they are merely
    vigorous and faithful representations of what anybody might have witnessed, when a
    traitor like Ravaillac or a Lombard <i>untore</i> was being put to death in agony.
    His firm mental grip on cruelty, and the somber gloom with which he invested these
    ghastly transcripts from the torture-chamber, prove Ribera true to his Spanish
    origin. Caravaggio delighted in color, and was indeed a colorist of high rank,
    considering the times in which he lived. Spagnoletto rejoiced in somber shadows, as
    though to illustrate the striking sonnet I have quoted in another place from
    Campanella.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>
    <p>This digression upon the Naturalists was needed partly to illustrate the nature of
    the attempted revival of the art of painting at this epoch, and partly to introduce
    two notable masters of the Bolognese school. Lionello Spada, a street-arab of
    Bologna, found his way into the studio of the Caracci, where he made himself a
    favorite by roguish ways and ready wit. He afterwards joined Caravaggio, and, when he
    reappeared in Lombardy, he had formed a manner of his own, more resplen<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id="page365"></a>{365}</span> dent in color and
    more naturalistic than that of the Caracci, but with less of realism than his Roman
    teacher's. If I could afford space for anecdotical details, the romance of Spada's
    life would furnish much entertaining material. But I must press on toward Guercino,
    who represents in a more famous personality this blending of the Bolognese and
    Naturalistic styles. Giovanni Francesco Barbieri got his nickname of Il Guercino, or
    the 'Squintling,' from an accident which distorted his right eye in babyhood. Born of
    poor parents, he was apprenticed to indifferent painters in Bologna at an early age,
    his father agreeing to pay for the boy's education by a load of grain and a vat of
    grapes delivered yearly. Thus Guercino owed far less to academical studies than to
    his own genius. Being Lodovico Caracci's junior by thirty-five years, and Annibale's
    by thirty, he had ample opportunities for studying the products of their school in
    Bologna, without joining the Academy. A generation lay between him and the first
    Eclectics. Nearly the same space of time separated Guercino from the founder of the
    Naturalists, and it was universally admitted in his lifetime that he owed to
    Caravaggio in coloring no less than he derived from the Caracci in sobriety and
    dignity of conception. These qualities of divergent schools Guercino combined in a
    manner marked by salient individuality. As a colorist, he approached the
    Tenebrosi&mdash;those lovers of surcharged shadows and darkened hues, whose gloom
    culminated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366" id="page366"></a>{366}</span>
    Ribera. But we note a fat and buttery <i>impasto</i> in Guercino, which distinguishes
    his work from the drier and more meager manner of the Roman-Neapolitan painters. It
    is something characteristic of Bologna, a richness which we might flippantly compare
    to sausage, or a Flemish smoothness, indicating Calvaert's influence. More than this,
    Guercino possessed a harmony of tones peculiar to himself, and strongly contrasted
    with Guido's silver-gray gradations. Guido's coloring, at its best, often reminds one
    of olive branches set against a blue sea and pale horizon in faintly amber morning
    light. The empurpled indigoes, relieved by smouldering Venetian red, which Guercino
    loved, suggest thunder-clouds, dispersed, rolling away through dun subdued glare of
    sunset reflected upward from the west. And this scheme of color, vivid but heavy,
    luminous but sullen, corresponded to what contemporaries called the
    Terribilit&agrave; of Guercino's conception. Terribleness was a word which came into
    vogue to describe Michelangelo's grand manner. It implied audacity of imagination,
    dashing draughtsmanship, colossal scale, something demonic and decisive in
    execution.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> The terrible takes in Guercino's
    work far lower flights than in the Sistine Chapel. With Michelangelo it soared like
    an eagle; with Guercino it flitted like a bat. His brawny saints are ponderous, not
    awe-inspiring.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367" id="page367"></a>{367}</span> Yet we feel
    that the man loved largeness, massiveness, and volume; that he was preoccupied with
    intellectual problems; planning deeply, and constructing strongly, under conditions
    unfavorable to spiritual freedom.</p>
    <p>Guercino lived the life of an anchorite, absorbed in studies, unwived, sober,
    pious, truthful, sincere in his commerce with the world, unaffectedly virtuous,
    devoted to his art and God. Some of his pictures bring forcibly before our minds the
    religious <i>milieu</i> created by the Catholic Revival. I will take the single
    instance of a large oil-painting in the Bolognese Gallery. It represents the
    reception of a Duke of Aquitaine into monastic orders by S. Bernard. The knightly
    quality of the hero is adequately portrayed; his piety is masculine. But an accessory
    to the main subject of the composition arrests attention. A monk, earnestly pleading,
    emphatically gesticulating, addresses himself to the task of converting a young
    squire. Perugino, or even Raphael, would have brought the scene quite otherwise
    before us. The Duke's consecration would of course have occupied a commanding place
    in the picture. But the episodes would have been composed of comely groups or
    animated portraits. Guercino, obedient to the religious spirit of the
    Counter-Reformation, compels sympathy with ecclesiastical propaganda.</p>
    <p>Guido exercised a powerful influence over his immediate successors. Guercino felt
    it when he painted that soulless picture of Abraham and<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page368" id="page368"></a>{368}</span> Hagar, in the Brera&mdash;the picture
    which excited Byron's admiration, which has been praised for its accurate delineation
    of a teardrop, and which, when all is reckoned, has just nothing of emotion in it but
    a frigid inhumanity. He competed with Guido in the fresco of the Lodovisi Aurora, a
    substantial work certainly, yet one that lacks the saving qualities of the
    Rospigliosi ceiling&mdash;grace and geniality of fancy.</p>
    <p>In the history of criticism there are few things more perplexing than the
    vicissitudes of taste and celebrity, whereby the idols of past generations crumble
    suddenly to dust, while the despised and rejected are lifted to pinnacles of glory.
    Successive waves of aesthetical preference, following one upon the other with curious
    rapidity, sweep ancient fortresses of fame from their venerable basements, and raise
    upon the crests of wordy foam some delicate seashell that erewhile lay embedded in
    oblivious sand. During the last half-century, taste has been more capricious,
    revolutionary, and apparently anarchical than at any previous epoch. The unity of
    orthodox opinion has broken up. Critics have sought to display originality by
    depreciating names famous in former ages, and by exalting minor stars to the rank of
    luminaries of the first magnitude. A man, yet in middle life, can remember with what
    reverence engravings after Raphael, the Caracci, and Poussin were treated in his
    boyhood; how Fra Angelico and Perugino ruled at a somewhat later period; how one set
    of eloquent writers <span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"
    id="page369"></a>{369}</span> discovered Blake, another Botticelli, and a third
    Carpaccio; how Signorelli and Bellini and Mantegna received tardy recognition; and
    now, of late years, how Tiepolo has bidden fair to obtain the European <i>grido</i>.
    He will also bear in mind that the conditions of his own development&mdash;studies in
    the Elgin marbles, the application of photography to works of art, the publications
    of the Arundel Society, and that genius of new culture in the air which is more
    potent than all teaching, rendered for himself each oracular utterance interesting
    but comparatively unimportant&mdash;as it were but talk about truths evident to
    sight.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile, amid this gabble of 'sects and schisms,' this disputation which makes a
    simple mind take refuge in the epigram attributed to Swift on Handel and Bononcini,<a
    name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234"
    class="fnanchor">[234]</a> criticism and popular intelligence have been unanimous
    upon two points, first, in manifesting a general dislike for Italian art after the
    date of Raphael's third manner, and a particular dislike for the Bolognese painters;
    secondly, in an earnest effort to discriminate and exhibit what is sincere and
    beautiful in works to which our forefathers were unintelligibly irresponsive. A
    wholesome reaction, in one word, has taken place against academical dogmatism; and
    the study of art has been based upon appreciably better historical and aesthetical
    principles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page370" id="page370"></a>{370}</span></p>
    <p>The seeming confusion of the last half-century ought not, therefore, to shake our
    confidence in the possibility of arriving at stable laws of taste. Radical
    revolutions, however salutary, cannot be effected without some injustice to ideals of
    the past and without some ill-grounded enthusiasm for the ideals of the moment. Nor
    can so wide a region as that of modern European art be explored except by divers
    pioneers, each biassed by personal predilections and peculiar sensibilities, each
    liable to changes of opinion under the excitement of discovery, each followed by a
    coterie sworn to support their master's <i>ipse dixit</i>.</p>
    <p>The chief thing is to obtain a clear conception of the mental atmosphere in which
    sound criticism has to live and move and have its being. 'The form of this world
    passes; and I would fain occupy myself only with that which constitutes abiding
    relations.' So said Goethe; and these words have much the same effect as that
    admonition of his 'to live with steady purpose in the Whole, the Good, the
    Beautiful.' The true critic must divert his mind from what is transient and
    ephemeral, must fasten upon abiding relations, <i>bleibende Verh&auml;ltnisse</i>. He
    notes that one age is classical, another romantic; that <i>this</i> swears by Giotto,
    <i>that</i> by the Caracci. Meanwhile, he resolves to maintain that classics and
    romantics, the Caracci and Giotto, are alike only worthy of regard in so far as they
    exemplify the qualities which bring art into the sphere of abiding relations. One
    writer <span class="pagenum"><a name="page371" id="page371"></a>{371}</span> is
    eloquent for Fra Angelico, another for Rubens; the one has personal sympathy for the
    Fiesolan monk, the other for the Flemish courtier. Our true critic renounces
    idiosyncratic whims and partialities, striving to enter with firm purpose into the
    understanding of universal goodness and beauty. In so far as he finds truth in
    Angelico and Rubens, will he be appreciative of both.</p>
    <p>Aristotle laid it down as an axiom that the ultimate verdict in matters of taste
    is 'what the man of enlightened intelligence would decide.' The critic becomes a man
    of enlightened intelligence, a [Greek: phronimos], by following the line of Goethe's
    precepts. In working out self-culture, he will derive assistance by the way from the
    commanding philosophical conception of our century. All things with which we are
    acquainted are in evolutionary process. Everything belonging to human nature is in a
    state of organic transition&mdash;passing through necessary phases of birth, growth,
    decline, and death. Art, in any one of its specific manifestations&mdash;Italian
    painting for example&mdash;avoids this law of organic evolution, arrests development
    at the fairest season of growth, averts the decadence which ends in death, no more
    than does an oak. The oak, starting from an acorn, nourished by earth, air, light,
    and water, offers indeed a simpler problem than so complex an organism as Italian
    painting, developed under conditions of manifold diversity. Yet the dominant law
    controls both equally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"
    id="page372"></a>{372}</span></p>
    <p>It is not, however, in evolutions that we must seek the abiding relations spoken
    of by Goethe. The evolutionary conception does not supply those to students of art,
    though it unfolds a law which is permanent and of universal application in the world
    at large. It forces us to dwell on necessary conditions of mutability and
    transformation. It leads the critic to comprehend the whole, and encourages the habit
    of scientific tolerance. We are saved by it from uselessly fretting ourselves because
    of the ungodly and the inevitable; from mourning over the decline of Gothic
    architecture into Perpendicular aridity and flamboyant feebleness, over the passage
    of the scepter from Sophocles to Euripides or from Tasso to Marino, over the chaos of
    Mannerism, Eclecticism and Naturalism into which Italian painting plunged from the
    height of its maturity. This toleration and acceptance of unavoidable change need not
    imply want of discriminative perception. We can apply the evolutionary canon in all
    strictness without ignoring that adult manhood is preferable to senile decrepitude,
    that Pheidias surpasses the sculptors of Antinous, that one Madonna of Gian Bellini
    is worth all the pictures of the younger Palma, and that Dossi's portrait of the
    Ferrarese jester is better worth having than the whole of Annibale Caracci's Galleria
    Farnesina.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a
    href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> It will even lead us to select
    for models those works which bear <span class="pagenum"><a name="page373"
    id="page373"></a>{373}</span> the mark of adolescence or vigorous maturity, as
    supplying more fruitful sources for our own artistic education.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, not in evolution, but in man's soul, his intellectual and moral
    nature, must be sought those abiding relations which constitute sound art, and are
    the test of right aesthetic judgment. These are such as truth, simplicity, sobriety,
    love, grace, patience, modesty, thoughtfulness, repose, health, vigor, brain-stuff,
    dignity of imagination, lucidity of vision, purity, and depth of feeling. Wherever
    the critic finds these&mdash;whether it be in Giotto at the dawn or in Guido at the
    evensong of Italian painting, in Homer or Theocritus at the two extremes of Greek
    poetry&mdash;he will recognize the work as ranking with those things from which the
    soul draws nourishment. At the same time, he may not neglect the claims of
    craftsmanship. Each art has its own vehicle of expression, and exacts some innate
    capacity for the use of that vehicle from the artist. Therefore the critic must be
    also sufficiently versed in technicalities to give them their due value. It can,
    however, be laid down, as a general truth, that while immature or awkward workmanship
    is compatible with aesthetic excellence, technical dexterity, however skillfully
    applied, has never done anything for a soulless painter.</p>
    <p>Criticism, furthermore, implies judgment; and that judgment must be adjusted to
    the special nature of the thing criticised. Art is different from ethics, <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page374" id="page374"></a>{374}</span> from the physical
    world, from sensuality, however refined. It will not, therefore, in the long run do
    for the critic of an art to apply the same rules as the moralist, the naturalist, or
    the hedonist. It will not do for him to be contented with edification, or
    differentiation of species, or demonstrable delightfulness as the test-stone of
    artistic excellence. All art is a presentation of the inner human being, his thought
    and feeling, through the medium of beautiful symbols in form, color, and sound. Our
    verdict must therefore be determined by the amount of thought, the amount of feeling,
    proper to noble humanity, which we find adequately expressed in beautiful aesthetic
    symbols. And the man who shall pronounce this verdict is, now as in the days of
    Aristotle, the man of enlightened intelligence, sound in his own nature and open to
    ideas. Even his verdict will not be final; for no one is wholly free from
    partialities due to the age in which he lives, and to his special temperament. Still,
    a consensus of such verdicts eventually forms that voice of the people which,
    according to an old proverb, is the voice of God. Slowly, and after many successive
    siftings, the cumulative votes of the <i>phronimoi</i> decide. Insurgents against
    their judgment, in the case of acknowledged masters like Pheidias, Michelangelo,
    Shakespeare, are doomed to final defeat, because this judgment is really based upon
    abiding relations between art and human nature.</p>
    <p>Our hope with regard to the unity of taste in the future then is, that, all
    sentimental or academical <span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"

    <p>This digression was forced upon me by the difficulty of properly appreciating the
    Bolognese Eclectics now. What would be the amused astonishment of Sir Joshua
    Reynolds, if he returned to London at the present moment, and beheld the Dagon of his
    esteemed Caracci dashed to pieces by the ark of Botticelli&mdash;Carpaccio
    enthroned&mdash;Raffaello stigmatized as the stone of stumbling and the origin of
    evil? Yet Reynolds had as good a right to his opinion as any living master of the
    brush, or any living masters of language. There is no doubt that the Bolognese
    painters sufficed for the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"
    id="page376"></a>{376}</span> eighteenth century, whose taste indeed they had
    created.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a

    main business of a critic is to try to answer two questions: first why did the epoch
    produce such art, and why did it rejoice in it?&mdash;secondly, has this art any real
    worth beyond a documentary value for the students of one defined historical period;
    has it enduring qualities of originality, strength, beauty, and inspiration? To the
    first of these questions I have already given some answer by showing under what
    conditions the Caracci reacted against mannerism. In the due consideration of the
    second we are hampered by the culture of our period, which has strongly prejudiced
    all minds against the results of that reaction.</p>
    <p>The painting of the Eclectics was not spontaneous art. It was art mechanically
    revived during a period of critical hesitancy and declining enthusiasms. It was
    produced at Bologna, 'la dotta' or 'la grassa,' by Bolognese craftsmen. This is worth
    remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377" id="page377"></a>{377}</span> ing;
    for except Guido Guinicelli and Francesco Raibolini, no natives of Bologna were
    eminently gifted for the arts. And Bologna was the city famous for her ponderous
    learning, famous also for the good cheer of her table, neither erudition nor savory
    meats being essential to the artist's temperament. The painting which emerged there
    at the close of the sixteenth century embodied religion and culture, both of a base
    alloy. The Christianity of the age was not na&iuml;ve, simple, sincere, and popular,
    like that of the thirteenth century; but hysterical, dogmatic, hypocritical, and
    sacerdotal. It was not Christianity indeed, but Catholicism galvanized by terror into
    reactionary movement. The culture of the age was on the wane. Men had long lost their
    first clean perception of classical literature, and the motives of the mediaeval past
    were exhausted. Therefore, though the Eclectics went on painting the old subjects,
    they painted all alike with frigid superficiality. If we examine the lists of
    pictures turned out by the Caracci and Guercino, we shall find a pretty equal
    quantity of saints and Susannas, Judiths and Cleopatras, Davids and Bacchuses,
    Jehovahs and Jupiters, anchorites and Bassarids, Faiths and Fortunes, cherubs and
    Cupids. Artistically, all are on the same dead level of inspiration. Nothing new or
    vital, fanciful or imaginative, has been breathed into antique mythology. What has
    been added to religious expression is repellent. Extravagantly ideal in ecstatic
    Magdalens and Maries, extravagantly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"
    id="page378"></a>{378}</span> realistic in martyrdoms and torments, extravagantly
    harsh in dogmatic mysteries and the ecclesiastical parade of power, extravagantly
    soft in sentimental tenderness and tearful piety, this new religious element, the
    element of the Inquisition, the Tridentine Council, and the Jesuits, contradicts the
    true gospel of Christ. The painting which embodies it belongs to a spirit at strife
    with what was vital and progressive in the modern world. It is therefore naturally
    abhorrent to us now; nor can it be appreciated except by those who yearn for the
    triumph of ultramontane principles.</p>
    <p>If we turn from the intellectual content of this art to its external
    manifestation, we shall find similar reasons for its failure to delight or satisfy.
    The ambition of the Caracci was to combine in one the salient qualities of earlier
    masters. This ambition doomed their style to the sterility of hybrids. Moreover, in
    selecting, they omitted just those features which had given grace and character to
    their models. The substitution of generic types for portraiture, the avoidance of
    individuality, the contempt for what is simple and natural in details, deprived their
    work of attractiveness and suggestion. It is noticeable that they never painted
    flowers. While studying Titian's landscapes, they omitted the iris and the
    caper-blossom and the columbine which star the grass beneath Ariadne's feet. The
    lessons of the rocks and chestnut-trees of his S. Jeromes Solitude were lost on them.
    They began the false <span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"
    id="page379"></a>{379}</span> system of depicting ideal foliage and ideal
    precipices&mdash;that is to say, trees which are not trees, and cliffs which cannot
    be distinguished from cork or stucco. In like manner, the clothes wherewith they clad
    their personages were not of brocade or satin or broadcloth, but of that empty lie
    called drapery. The purpled silks of Titian's Lilac Lady, in the Pitti, the
    embroidered hems of Boccaccini da Cremona, the crimson velvet of Raphael's Joanna of
    Aragon, Veronese's cloth of silver and shot taffety, are replaced by one monotonous
    nondescript stuff, differently dyed in dull or glaring colors, but always shoddy.
    Characteristic costumes have disappeared. We shall not find in any of their Massacres
    of the Innocents a soldier like Bonifazio's Dall'Armi. In lieu of gems with flashing
    facets, or of quaint jewels from the Oreficeria, they adorn their kings and
    princesses with nothing less elevated than polished gold and ropes of pearls. After
    the same fashion, furniture, utensils, houses, animals, birds, weapons, are
    idealized&mdash;stripped, that is to say, of what in these things is specific and
    vital.</p>
    <p>It would be incorrect to say that there are no exceptions in Eclectic painting to
    this evil system. Yet the sweeping truth remains that the Caracci returned, not to
    what was best in their predecessors, but to what was dangerous and misleading.</p>
    <p>The 'grand style,' in Sir Joshua's sense of that phrase, denoting style which
    eliminates specific and characteristic qualities from objects, replacing them <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page380" id="page380"></a>{380}</span> by so-called 'ideal'
    generalities, had already made its appearance in Raphael, Correggio, and Buonarroti
    We even find it in Da Vinci's Last Supper. Yet in Raphael it comes attended with
    divine grace; in Correggio with faun-like radiancy of gladness; in Buonarroti with
    Sinaitic sublimity; in Da Vinci with penetrative force of psychological
    characterization. The Caracci and their followers, with a few exceptions&mdash;Guido
    at his best being the notablest&mdash;brought nothing of these saving virtues to the
    pseudo-grand style.</p>
    <p>It was this delusion regarding nobility and elevation in style which betrayed so
    genial a painter as Reynolds into his appreciation of the Bolognese masters. He
    admired them; but he admired Titian, Raphael, Correggio, and Buonarroti more. And he
    admired the Eclectics because they developed the perilous part of the great Italian
    tradition. Just as Coleridge recommended young students of dramatic verse to found
    their style at first on Massinger rather than on Shakespeare, so Reynolds thought
    that the Caracci were sound models for beginners in the science of idealization.
    Shakespeare and Michelangelo are inimitable; Massinger and the Caracci exhibit the
    one thing needful to be learned, upon a scale not wholly unattainable by industry and
    talent. That was the line of argument; and, granted that the pseudo-grand style is a
    <i>sine qu&acirc; non</i> of painting, Reynolds's position was logical.<a
    name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238"
    class="fnanchor">[238]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"
    id="page381"></a>{381}</span></p>
    <p>The criticism and the art-practice of this century have combined to shake our
    faith in the grand style. The spirit of the Romantic movement, penetrating poetry
    first, then manifesting itself in the reflective writings of Rio and Lord Lindsay,
    Ruskin and Gautier, producing the English landscape-painters and pre-Raphaelites, the
    French Realists and Impressionists, has shifted the center of gravity in taste.
    Science, too, contributes its quota. Histories of painting, like Kugler's, and Crowe
    and Cavalcaselle's, composed in an impartial and searching spirit of investigation,
    place students at a point of view removed from prejudice and academical canons of
    perfection. Only here and there, under special reactionary influences, as in the
    Dusseldorf and Munich schools of religious purists, has anything approaching to the
    eighteenth-century 'grand style' delusion reappeared.</p>
    <p>Why, therefore, the Eclectics are at present pining in the shade of neglect is now
    sufficiently apparent. We dislike their religious sentiments. We repudiate their
    false and unimaginative ideality. We recognize their touch on antique mythology to be
    cold and lifeless. Superficial imitations of Niobe and the Belvedere Apollo have no
    attraction for a generation educated by the marbles of the Parthenon. Dull
    reproductions of Raphael's manner at his worst cannot delight men satiated with
    Raphael's manner <span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"
    id="page382"></a>{382}</span> at his best. Whether the whirligig of time will bring
    about a revenge for the Eclectics yet remains to be seen. Taste is so capricious, or
    rather the conditions which create taste are so complex and inscrutable, that even
    this, which now seems impossible, may happen in the future. But a modest prediction
    can be hazarded that nothing short of the substitution of Catholicism for science and
    of Jesuitry for truth in the European mind will work a general revolution in their
    favor.</p>

    </div>
    <p>I.</p>
    <p>The four main events of European history since the death of Christ are the decline
    of Graeco-Roman civilization, the triumph of Christianity as a new humanizing agency,
    the intrusion of Teutonic and Slavonic tribes into the comity of nations, and the
    construction of the modern world of thought by Renaissance and Reformation.</p>
    <p>As seems to be inevitable in the progress of our species, each of these changes
    involved losses, compensated by final gains; for humanity moves like a glacier,
    plastically, but with alternating phases of advance and retreat, obeying laws of
    fracture and regelation.</p>
    <p>It would thus be easy to deplore the collapse of that mighty and beneficent
    organism which we call <span class="pagenum"><a name="page384"
    id="page384"></a>{384}</span> the Roman Empire. Yet without this collapse how could
    the Catholic Church have supplied inspiration to peoples gifted with fresh faculties,
    endowed with insight differing from that of Greeks and Romans?</p>
    <p>It is tempting to lament the extinction of arts letters, and elaborated habits of
    civility, which followed the barbarian invasions. Yet without such extinction, how
    can we imagine to ourselves the growth of those new arts, original literatures, and
    varied modes of social culture, to which we give the names of mediaeval, chivalrous,
    or feudal?</p>
    <p>It is obvious that we can quarrel with the Renaissance for having put an end to
    purely Christian arts and letters by imposing a kind of pagan mannerism on the
    spontaneous products of the later mediaeval genius. But without this reversion to the
    remaining models of antique culture, how could the European races have become
    conscious of historical continuity; how could the corrupt system of Papal domination
    have been broken by Reform; how, finally, could Science, the vital principle of our
    present civilization, have been evolved?</p>
    <p>In all these instances it appears that the old order must yield place to the new,
    not only because the new is destined to incorporate and supersede it, but also
    because the old has become unfruitful. Thus, the Roman Empire, having discharged its
    organizing function, was decrepit, and classical civilization, after exhibiting its
    strength in season, was decaying when the Latin priesthood and the bar<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>{385}</span> barians entered that
    closed garden of antiquity, and trampled it beneath their feet. Mediaeval religion
    and modes of thought, in like manner, were at the point of ossifying, when Humanism
    intervened to twine the threads of past and present into strands that should be
    strong as cables for the furtherance of future energy.</p>
    <p>It is incontestable that the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation, each of them
    on different grounds antagonistic to the Renaissance, appear to have retarded that
    emancipation of the reason, begun by Humanism, which is still in progress.
    Nevertheless, the strife of Protestantism and Catholicism was needed for preserving
    moral and religious elements which might have been too lightly dropped, and for
    working these into the staple of the modern consciousness. The process of the last
    three centuries, attended as it has been by serious drawbacks to the Spanish and
    Italian peoples, and by a lamentable waste of vigor to the Teutonic nations, has yet
    resulted in a permeation of the modern compost with the leaven of Christianity.
    Unchecked, it is probable that the Renaissance would have swept away much that was
    valuable and deserved to be permanent. Nor, without the flux and reflux of contending
    principles by which Europe was agitated in the Counter-Reformation period, could the
    equipoise of reciprocally attracting and repelling States, which constitutes the
    modern as different from the ancient or the mediaeval groundwork of political
    existence, have been so efficiently established.<span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page386" id="page386"></a>{386}</span></p>
    <p>II.</p>
    <p>Permanence and homogeneity are not to be predicated of 'anything that's merely
    ours and mortal.' We have missed the whole teaching of history if we wail aloud
    because Greek and Roman culture succumbed to barbarism, out of which mediaeval
    Christianity emerged; because the revival of learning diverted arts and letters in
    each Occidental nation from their home-plowed channels; because Protestant
    theologians and Spanish Jesuits impeded that self-evolution of the reason which
    Italian humanists inaugurated. No less futile were it to waste declamatory tears upon
    the strife of absolutism with new-fledged democracy, or to vaticinate a reign of
    socialistic terror for the immediate future. We have to recognize that man cannot be
    other than what he makes himself; and he makes himself in obedience to immutable
    although unwritten laws, whereof he only of late years became dimly conscious. It is
    well, then, while reflecting on the lessons of some deeply studied epoch in
    world-history, to regard the developments with which we have been specially occupied,
    no less than the ephemeral activity of each particular individual, as factors in a
    universal process, whereof none sees the issue, but which, willing or unwilling, each
    man helps to further. We shall then acknowledge that a contest between Conservatism
    and Liberalism, between established order and the order that is destined to replace
    it, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>{387}</span> between
    custom and innovation, constitutes the essence of vitality in human affairs. The
    nations by turns are protagonists in the drama of progress; by turns are doomed to
    play the part of obstructive agents. Intermingled in conflict which is active life,
    they contribute by their phases of declension and resistance, no less than by their
    forward movements, to the growth of an organism which shall probably in the far
    future be coextensive with the whole human race.</p>
    <p>III.</p>
    <p>These considerations are suggested to us by the subject I have handled in this
    work. The first five volumes were devoted to showing how Italy, in the Renaissance,
    elaborated a new way of regarding man and the world, a new system of education, new
    social manners, and a new type of culture for herself and Europe. This was her
    pioneer's work in the period of transition from the middle ages; and while she was
    engaged in it, all classes, from popes and princes down to poetlings and pedants,
    seemed for a while to have lost sight of Catholic Christianity. They were equally
    indifferent to that corresponding and contemporary movement across the Alps, which is
    known as Reformation. They could not discern the close link of connection which binds
    Renaissance to Reformation. Though at root identical in tendency towards freedom,
    these stirrings of the modern <span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"
    id="page388"></a>{388}</span> spirit assumed externally such diverse forms as made
    them reciprocally repellent. Only one European nation received both impulses
    simultaneously. That was England, which adopted Protestantism and produced the
    literature of Spenser, Bacon, and Shakespeare at the same epoch. France, earlier than
    England, felt Renaissance influences, and for some while seemed upon the point of
    joining the Reformation. But while the French were hesitating, Spain proclaimed
    herself the uncompromising enemy of Protestantism, and Rome, supported by this
    powerful ally, dragged Italy into the Catholic reaction. That effort aimed at
    galvanizing a decrepit Church into the semblance of vital energy, and, while
    professing the reformation of its corrupt system, stereotyped all that was
    antagonistic in its creed and customs to the spirit of the modern world. The Catholic
    Revival necessitated vigorous reaction, not only against Protestantism, but also
    against the Liberalism of the Renaissance and the political liberties of peoples. It
    triumphed throughout Southern Europe chiefly because France chose at length the
    Catholic side. But the triumph was only partial, condemning Spain and Italy indeed to
    intellectual barrenness for a season, but not sufficing to dominate and suppress the
    development of rationalism. The pioneer's work of Italy was over. She joined the
    ranks of obscurantists and obstructives. Germany, having failed to accomplish the
    Reformation in time, was distracted by the Catholic reaction, which <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>{389}</span> plunged her into a
    series of disastrous wars. It remained for England and Holland, not, however, without
    similar perturbations in both countries, to lead the van of progress through two
    centuries; after which this foremost post was assigned to France and the United
    States.</p>
    <p>IV.</p>
    <p>The views which I have maintained throughout my work upon the Renaissance will be
    found, I think, to be coherent. They have received such varied illustrations that it
    is difficult to recapitulate the principles on which they rest, without repetition.
    The main outline of the argument, however, is as follows. During the middle ages,
    Western Christendom recognized, in theory at least, the ideal of European unity under
    the dual headship of the Papacy and Empire. There was one civil order and one Church.
    Emperor and Pope, though frequently at strife, were supposed to support each other
    for the common welfare of Christendom. That mediaeval conception has now, in the
    centuries which we call modern, passed into oblivion; and the period in which it
    ceased to have effective value we denote as the period of the Renaissance and the
    Reformation. So long as the ideal held good, it was possible for the Papacy to stamp
    out heresies and to stifle the earlier stirrings of antagonistic culture. Thus the
    precursory movements to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page390"
    id="page390"></a>{390}</span> I alluded in the first chapter of my 'Age of the
    Despots,' seemed to be abortive; and no less apparently abortive were the reformatory
    efforts of Wyclif and Huss. Yet Europe was slowly undergoing mental and moral
    changes, which announced the advent of a new era. These changes were more apparent in
    Italy than elsewhere, through the revival of arts and letters early in the fourteenth
    century. Cimabue, Giotto, and the Pisani, Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, set culture
    forward on fresh paths divergent from previous mediaeval tradition. The gradual
    enfeeblement of the Empire and the distraction of the Church during the Great Schism
    prepared the means whereby both Renaissance and Reformation were eventually realized.
    The Council of Constance brought the Western nations into active diplomatical
    relations, and sowed seeds of thought which afterwards sprang up in Luther.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile a special nidus had been created in the South. The Italian communes
    freed themselves from all but titular subjection to the Empire, and were practically
    independent of the Papacy during its exile in Avignon. They succumbed to despots, and
    from Italian despotism emerged the Machiavellian conception of the State. This
    conception, modified in various ways, by Sarpi's theory of Church and State, by the
    Jesuit theory of Papal Supremacy, by the counter-theory of the Divine Right of Kings,
    by theories of Social Contract and the Divine Right of Nations, superseded the elder
    ideal of Universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"
    id="page391"></a>{391}</span> Monarchy. It grew originally out of the specific
    conditions of Italy in the fifteenth century, and acquired force from that habit of
    mind, fostered by the Classical Revival, which we call humanism. Humanism had
    flourished in Italy since the days of Petrarch, and had been communicated by Italian
    teachers to the rest of Europe. As in the South it generated the new learning and the
    new culture which I have described in the first five volumes of my work, and acted as
    a solvent on the mediaeval idea of the Empire, so in the North it generated a new
    religious enthusiasm and acted as a solvent on the mediaeval idea of the Church. All
    through the middle ages, nothing seemed more formidable to the European mind than
    heresy. Any sacrifices were willingly made in order to secure the unity of the
    Catholic Communion. But now, by the Protestant rebellion, that spell was broken, and
    the right of peoples to choose their faith, in dissent from a Church declared
    corrupt, was loudly proclaimed.</p>
    <p>So long as we keep this line of reasoning in view, we shall recognize why it is
    not only uncritical, but also impossible, to separate the two movements severally
    called Renaissance and Reformation. Both had a common root in humanism, and humanism
    owed its existence on the one hand to the recovery of antique literature, on the
    other to the fact that the Papacy, instead of striving to stamp it out as it had
    stamped out Proven&ccedil;al civilization, viewed it at first with approval. The new
    learning, as our an<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"
    id="page392"></a>{392}</span> cestors were wont to call it, involved, in Michelet's
    pregnant formula, the discovery of the world and man, and developed a spirit of
    revolt against mediaevalism in all its manifestations. Its fruits were speedily
    discerned in bold exploratory studies, sound methods of criticism, audacious
    speculation, and the free play of the intellect over every field of knowledge. This
    new learning had time and opportunity for full development in Italy, and for adequate
    extension to the Northern races, before its real tendencies were suspected. When that
    happened, the transition from the mediaeval to the modern age had been secured. The
    Empire was obsolete. The Church was forced into reaction. Europe became the
    battle-field of progressive and retrogressive forces, the scene of a struggle between
    two parties which can best be termed Liberalism and Conservatism.</p>
    <p>Stripping the subject of those artistic and literary associations which we are
    accustomed to connect with the word Renaissance, these seem to me the most essential
    points to bear in mind about this movement. Then, when we have studied the diverse
    antecedent circumstances of the German and Italian races, when we take into account
    their national qualities, and estimate the different aims and divergent enthusiasms
    evoked in each by humanistic ardor, we shall perceive how it came to pass that
    Renaissance and Reformation clashed together in discordant opposition to the Catholic
    Revival.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page393" id="page393"></a>{393}</span></p>
    <p>V.</p>
    <p>Italy, through the Roman Republic, the Roman Empire, and the Roman Church, gave
    discipline, culture, and religion to the Western world. But, during the course of
    this civilizing process, a force arose in Northern Europe which was destined to
    transfer the center of gravity from the Mediterranean basin northwards. The Teutonic
    tribes effaced the Western Empire, adopted Christianity, and profoundly modified what
    still survived of Latin civility among the Occidental races. A new factor was thus
    introduced into the European community, which had to be assimilated to the old; and
    the genius of the Italian people never displayed itself more luminously than in the
    ability with which the Bishops of Rome availed themselves of this occasion. They
    separated the Latin from the Greek Church, and, by the figment of the Holy Roman
    Empire, cemented Southern and Northern Europe into an apparently cohesive whole.
    After the year A.D. 800, Europe, from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, acknowledged a
    dual headship; Papacy and Empire ranking as ideals under which the unity of
    Christendom subsisted in a multiplicity of separate and self-evolving nations.</p>
    <p>The concordat between Latin Church and German Empire, the one representing
    traditions of antique intelligence and southern habits of State organization, the
    other introducing the young energies of half-cultivated peoples and the chivalry of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>{394}</span> the North, was
    never perfect. Yet, incomplete as the fusion between Roman and Teuton actually was,
    it had a common basis in religion, and it enabled the federated peoples to maintain
    recognized international relations. What we now call Renaissance and Reformation
    revealed still unreconciled antagonisms between Southern and Northern, Latin and
    German, factors in this mediaeval Europe. Italy, freed for a while from both Papacy
    and Empire, expressed her intellectual energy in the Revival of Learning, developing
    that bold investigating spirit to which the names of Humanism or of Rationalism may
    be given. The new learning, the new enthusiasm for inquiry, the new study of the
    world and man, as subjects of vital interest irrespective of our dreamed-of life
    beyond the grave, stimulated in Italy what we know as Renaissance; while in Germany
    it led to what we know as Reformation. The Reformation must be regarded as the
    Teutonic counterpart to the Italian Renaissance. It was what emerged from the core of
    that huge barbarian factor, which had sapped the Roman Empire, and accepted
    Catholicism; which lent its vigor to the mediaeval Empire, and which now participated
    in the culture of the classical Revival. As Italy restored freedom to human
    intelligence and the senses by arts and letters and amenities of refined existence,
    so Germany restored freedom to the soul and conscience by strenuous efforts after
    religious sincerity and political independence. The one people aim<span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>{395}</span> ing at a restoration
    of pagan civility beneath the shadow of Catholicism, the other seeking after a purer
    Christianity in antagonism to the Papal hierarchy, initiated from opposite points of
    view that complete emancipation of the modern mind which has not yet been fully
    realized.</p>
    <p>If we inquire why the final end to which both Renaissance and Reformation
    tended&mdash;namely, the liberation of the spirit from mediaeval prepossessions and
    impediments&mdash;has not been more perfectly attained, we find the cause of this
    partial failure in the contradictory conceptions formed by South and North of a
    problem which was at root one. Both Renaissance and Reformation had their origin in
    the revival of learning, or rather in that humanistic enthusiasm which was its vital
    essence. But the race-differences involved in these two movements were so
    irreconcilable, the objects pursued were so divergent, that Renaissance and
    Reformation came into the conflict of chemical combination, producing a ferment out
    of which the intellectual unity of Europe has not as yet clearly emerged. The Latin
    race, having created a new learning and a new culture, found itself at strife with
    the Teutonic race, which at the same period developed new religious conceptions and
    new political energies.</p>
    <p>The Church supplied a battle-field for these hostilities. The Renaissance was by
    no means favorable to the principles of Catholic orthodoxy; and the Italians showed
    themselves to be Christians <span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"
    id="page396"></a>{396}</span> by convention and tradition rather than by conviction
    in the fifteenth century. Yet Italy was well content to let the corrupt hierarchy of
    Papal Rome subsist, provided Rome maintained the attitude which Leo X. had adopted
    toward the liberal spirit of the Classical Revival. The Reformation, on the other
    hand, was openly antagonistic to the Catholic Church. Protestantism repudiated the
    toleration professed by skeptical philosophers and indulgent free-thinkers in the
    South, while it repelled those refined persons by theological fervor and moral
    indignation which they could not comprehend. Thus the Italian and the German children
    of humanism failed to make common cause against Catholicism, with which the former
    felt no sympathy and which the latter vehemently attacked. Meanwhile the Church awoke
    to a sense of her peril. The Papacy was still a force of the first magnitude; and it
    only required a vigorous effort to place it once more in an attitude of domination
    and resistance. This effort it made by reforming the ecclesiastical hierarchy,
    defining Catholic dogma, and carrying on a war of extermination against the twofold
    Liberalism of Renaissance and Reformation.</p>
    <p>That reactionary movement against the progress of free thought which extinguished
    the Italian Renaissance and repelled the Reformation, has formed the subject of the
    two preceding volumes of my work. It could not have been conducted by the Court of
    Rome without the help of Spain. The Spanish nation, at this epoch paramount in
    Europe, declared <span class="pagenum"><a name="page397"
    id="page397"></a>{397}</span> itself fanatically and unanimously for the Catholic
    Revival. In Italy it lent the weight of arms and overlordship to the Church for the
    suppression of popular liberties. It provided the Papacy with a spiritual militia
    specially disciplined to meet the exigencies of the moment. Yet the center of the
    reaction was still Rome; and the Spanish hegemony enabled the Roman hierarchy to
    consolidate an organism which has long survived its own influence in European
    affairs.</p>
    <p>VI.</p>
    <p>After the close of the Great Schism Rome began to obey the national impulses of
    the Italians, entered into their confederation as one of the five leading powers, and
    assumed externally the humanistic culture then in vogue. But the Church was a
    cosmopolitan institution. Its interests extended beyond the Alps, beyond the
    Pyrenees, beyond the oceans traversed by Portuguese and Spanish navigators. The
    Renaissance so far modified its structure that the Papacy continued politically to
    rank as an Italian power. Its headquarters could not be removed from the Tiber, and
    by the tacit consent of Latin Catholicism the Supreme Pontiff was selected from
    Italian prelates. Yet now, in 1530, it began to play a new part more consonant with
    its mediaeval functions and pretensions. Rome indeed had ceased to be the imperial
    capital of Europe, where the secular head of Christendom assumed the crown of Empire
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page398" id="page398"></a>{398}</span> from his peer
    the spiritual chieftain. The Eternal City in this new phase of modern history, which
    lasted until Vittorio Emmanuele's entrance into the Quirinal in 1870, gave the Pope a
    place among Catholic sovereigns. From his throne upon the seven hills he conducted
    with their approval and assistance the campaign of the Counter-Reformation. Instead
    of encouraging and developing what yet remained of Renaissance in Italy, instead of
    directing that movement of the self-emancipating mind beyond the stage of art and
    humanism into the stage of rationalism and science, the Church used its authority to
    bring back the middle ages and to repress national impulses. It made common cause
    with Spain for a common object&mdash;the maintenance of Italy in a state of political
    and intellectual bondage, and the subjugation of such provinces in Europe as had not
    been irretrievably lost to the Catholic cause. The Italians, as a nation, remained
    passive, but not altogether unwilling or unapproving spectators of the drama which
    was being enacted under Papal leadership beyond their boundaries. Once again their
    activity was merged in that of Rome&mdash;in the action of that State which had first
    secured for them the Empire of the habitable globe, and next the spiritual hegemony
    of the Western races, and from the predominance of which they had partially
    disengaged themselves during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It was the
    Papacy's sense of its own danger as a cosmopolitan institution, combined <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page399" id="page399"></a>{399}</span> with the crushing
    superiority of Spain in the peninsula, which determined this phase of Italian
    history.</p>
    <p>The Catholic Revival, like the Renaissance, may in a certain sense be viewed as a
    product of Italian genius. This is sufficiently proved by the diplomatic history of
    the Tridentine Council, and by the dedication of the Jesuits to Papal service. It
    must, however, be remembered that while the Renaissance emanated from the race at
    large, from its confederation of independent republics and tyrannies, the Catholic
    Revival emanated from that portion of the race which is called Rome, from the
    ecclesiastical hierarchy imbued with world-wide ambitions in which national interests
    were drowned. There is nothing more interesting to the biographer of the Italians
    than the complicated correlation in which they have always stood to the cosmopolitan
    organism of Rome, itself Italian. In their antique days of greatness Rome subdued
    them, and by their native legions won the overlordship of the world. After the
    downfall of the Empire the Church continued Roman traditions in an altered form, but
    it found itself unable to dispense with the foreign assistance of Franks and Germans.
    The price now paid by Italy for spiritual headship in Europe was subjection to
    Teutonic suzerains and perpetual intriguing interference in her affairs. During the
    Avignonian captivity and the Great Schism, Italy developed intellectual and
    confederative unity, imposing her laws of culture and of state-craft even on the
    Papacy when it returned to Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400"
    id="page400"></a>{400}</span> But again at the close of the Renaissance, when Italian
    independence had collapsed, the Church aspired to spiritual supremacy; and at this
    epoch she recompensed her Spanish ally by aiding and abetting in the enslavement of
    the peninsula. Still the Roman Pontiff, who acted as generalissimo of the Catholic
    armies throughout Europe, was now more than ever recognized as an Italian power.</p>
    <p>VII.</p>
    <p>In his review of Ranke's <i>History of the Popes</i> Lord Macaulay insists with
    brilliant eloquence upon the marvelous vitality and longevity of the Roman Catholic
    Church. He describes the insurrection of the intellect against her rule in Provence,
    and her triumph in the Crusade which sacrificed a nation to the conception of
    mediaeval religious unity. He dwells on her humiliation in exile at Avignon, her
    enfeeblement during the Great Schism, and her restoration to splendor and power at
    the close of the Councils. Then he devotes his vast accumulated stores of learning
    and his force of rhetoric to explain the Reformation, the Catholic Revival, and the
    Counter-Reformation. He proves abundantly what there was in the organism of the
    Catholic Church and in the temper of Papal Rome, which made these now reactionary
    powers more than a match for Protestantism. 'In fifty years from the day on which
    Luther publicly renounced communion with the Papacy, and burned the bull of Leo
    before <span class="pagenum"><a name="page401" id="page401"></a>{401}</span> the
    gates of Wittenberg, Protestantism attained its highest ascendency, an ascendency
    which it soon lost, and which it never regained.' This sentence forms the theme for
    Lord Macaulay's survey of the Catholic Revival. Dazzling and fascinating as that
    survey is, it fails through misconception of one all-important point. Lord Macaulay
    takes for granted that conflict in Europe, since the publication of Luther's
    manifesto against Rome, has been between Catholicism and Protestantism. Even after
    describing the cataclysm of the French Revolution, he winds up his argument with
    these words: 'We think it a most remarkable fact that no Christian nation, which did
    not adopt the principles of the Reformation before the end of the sixteenth century,
    should ever have adopted them. Catholic communities have, since that time, become
    infidel and Catholic again; but none has become Protestant.' This is tantamount to
    regarding Protestantism as something fixed and final in itself, as a permanent and
    necessary form of Christianity. Here lies the fallacy which makes his reasoning, in
    spite of all its eloquence, but superficial. Protestantism, in truth, has never been
    more than a half-way house or halting-place between Catholicism and what may
    variously be described as free thought or science or rationalism. Being in its origin
    critical&mdash;being, as its name implies, a protest and an
    opposition&mdash;Protestantism was doomed to sterility, whenever it hardened into one
    or other of its dogmatic forms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"
    id="page402"></a>{402}</span> As critics and insurgents, Luther and Calvin rank among
    the liberators of the modern intellect. As founders of intolerant and mutually
    hostile Christian sects, Luther and Calvin rank among the retarders of modern
    civilization. In subsequent thinkers of whom both sects have disapproved, we may
    recognize the veritable continuators of their work in its best aspect. The Lutheran
    and Calvinist Churches are but backwaters and stagnant pools, left behind by the
    subsidence of rivers in flood, separated from the tidal stress of cosmic forces.
    Macaulay's misconception of the true character of Protestantism, which is to
    Catholicism what the several dissenting bodies are to the English Establishment, has
    diverted his attention from the deeper issues involved in the Counter-Reformation. He
    hardly touches upon Rome's persecution of free thought, upon her obstinate opposition
    to science. Consequently, he is not sufficiently aware that Copernicus and Bruno
    were, even in the sixteenth century, far more dangerous foes to Catholicism than were
    the leaders of the Reformed Churches. Copernicus and Bruno, the lineal ancestors of
    Helmholtz and Darwin, headed that opposition to Catholicism which has been continuous
    and potent to the present day, which has never retreated into backwaters or stagnated
    in slumbrous pools. From this opposition the essence of Christianity, the spirit
    which Christ bequeathed to his disciples, has nothing to fear. But Catholicism
    and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403" id="page403"></a>{403}</span>
    Protestantism alike, in so far as both are dogmatic and reactionary, clinging to
    creeds which will not bear the test of scientific investigation, to myths which have
    lost their significance in the light of advancing knowledge, and to methods of
    interpreting the Scriptures at variance with the canons of historical criticism, have
    very much to fear from this opposition. Lord Macaulay thinks it a most remarkable
    fact that no Christian nation has adopted the principles of the Reformation since the
    end of the sixteenth century. He does not perceive that, in every race of Europe, all
    enlightened thinkers, whether we name Bacon or Descartes, Spinoza or Leibnitz, Goethe
    or Mazzini, have adopted and carried forward those principles in their essence. That
    they have not proclaimed themselves Protestants unless they happened to be born
    Protestants, ought not to arouse his wonder, any more than that Washington and Heine
    did not proclaim themselves Whigs. For Protestantism, when it became dogmatic and
    stereotyped itself in sects, ceased to hold any vital relation to the forward
    movement of modern thought. The Reformation, in its origin, was, as I have tried to
    show, the Northern and Teutonic manifestation of that struggle after intellectual
    freedom, which in Italy and France had taken shape as Renaissance. But Calvinism,
    Lutheranism, Zwinglianism, and Anglicanism renounced that struggle only less
    decidedly than Catholicism; and in some of their specific phases, in Puritanism <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page404" id="page404"></a>{404}</span> for example, they
    showed themselves even more antagonistic to liberal culture and progressive thought
    than did the Roman Church.</p>
    <p>Whatever may be thought about the future of Catholicism (and no prudent man will
    utter prophecies upon such matters), there can be no doubt that the universal mind of
    the Christian races, whether Catholic or Protestant, has been profoundly penetrated
    and permeated with rationalism, which, springing simultaneously in Reformation and
    Renaissance out of humanism, has supplied the spiritual life of the last four
    centuries. This has created science in all its branches. This has stimulated critical
    and historical curiosity. This has substituted sound for false methods of inquiry,
    the love of truth for attachment to venerable delusion. This has sustained the
    unconquerable soul of man in its persistent effort after liberty and its revolt
    against the tyranny of priests and princes. At present, civilization seems threatened
    by more potent foes than the Roman Church, nor is it likely that these foes will seek
    a coalition with Catholicism.</p>
    <p>As a final remark upon this topic, it should be pointed out that Protestantism, in
    spite of the shortcomings I have indicated, has, on the whole, been more favorable to
    intellectual progress than Catholicism. For Protestantism was never altogether
    oblivious of its origin in revolt against unjust spiritual domination, while
    Catholicism has steadily <span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"
    id="page405"></a>{405}</span> maintained its conservative attitude of self-defense by
    repression. This suffices to explain another point insisted on by Lord
    Macaulay&mdash;namely, that those nations in which Protestantism took root have
    steadily advanced, while the decay of Southern Europe can be mainly ascribed to the
    Catholic Revival. The one group of nations have made progress, not indeed because
    they were Protestants, but because they were more obedient to the Divine Mind, more
    in sympathy with the vital principle of movement, more open to rationalism. The other
    group of nations have declined, because Catholicism after the year 1530, wilfully
    separated itself from truth and liberty and living force, and obstinately persisted
    in serving the false deities of an antiquated religion.</p>
    <p>VIII.</p>
    <p>Few periods in history illustrate the law of reaction and retrogression, to which
    all processes of civil progress are subject, more plainly and more sadly than the one
    with which I have been dealing in these volumes. The Renaissance in Italy started
    with the fascination of a golden dream; and like the music of a dream, it floated
    over Europe. But the force which had stimulated humanity to this delightful
    reawakening of senses and intelligence, stirred also the slumbering religious
    conscience, and a yearning after personal emancipation. Protestantism arose like a
    stern reality, plunging the nations into <span class="pagenum"><a name="page406"
    id="page406"></a>{406}</span> confused and deadly conflict, arousing antagonisms in
    established orders, unleashing cupidities and passions which had lurked within the
    breasts of manifold adventurers. The fifteenth century closed to a solemn symphony.
    After the middle of the sixteenth, discord sounded from every quarter of the
    Occidental world. Italy lay trampled on and dying. Spain reared her dragon's crest of
    menacing ambition and remorseless fanaticism. France was torn by factions and
    devoured by vicious favorites of corrupt kings. Germany heaved like a huge ocean in
    the grip of a tumultuous gyrating cyclone. England passed through a complex
    revolution, the issue of which, under the sway of three Tudor monarchs, appeared
    undecided, until the fourth by happy fate secured the future of her people. It is not
    to be wondered that, in these circumstances, a mournful discouragement should have
    descended on the age; that men should have become more dubitative; that arts and
    letters should have seemed to pine upon unfertile ground. The nutriment they needed
    was absorbed by plants of fiercer and ranker growth, religious hatreds, political
    greeds, relentless passions burning in the hearts of princes and of populations.</p>
    <p>IX.</p>
    <p>Italy had already given so much of mental and social civilization to Europe, that
    her quiescence at this epoch can scarcely supply a substantial theme for <span
    class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>{407}</span> rhetorical
    lamentations. Marino and Guido Reni prove that the richer veins of Renaissance art
    and poetry had been worked out. The lives of Aldus the younger and Muretus show that
    humanism was well-nigh exhausted on its native soil. This will not, however, prevent
    us from deploring the untimely frost cast by persecution on Italy's budding boughs of
    knowledge. While we rejoice in Galileo, we must needs shed tears of fiery wrath over
    the passion of Campanella and the stake of Bruno. Meanwhile the tree of genius was
    ever green and vital in that Saturnian land of culture. Poetry, painting, sculpture,
    and architecture, having borne their flowers and fruits, retired to rest. Scholarship
    faded; science was nipped in its unfolding season by unkindly influences. But music
    put forth lusty shoots and flourished, yielding a new paradise of harmless joy, which
    even priests could grudge not to the world, and which lulled tyranny to sleep with
    silvery numbers.</p>
    <p>Thanks be to God that I who pen these pages, and that you who read them, have
    before us in this year of grace the spectacle of a resuscitated Italy! In this last
    quarter of the nineteenth century, the work of her heroes, Vittorio Emmanuele,
    Mazzini, Garibaldi, and Cavour, stands firmly founded. The creation of united Italy,
    that latest birth of the Italian genius, that most impossible of dreamed-of triumphs
    through long ages of her glory and greatness, compensates for all that she has borne
    in these <span class="pagenum"><a name="page408" id="page408"></a>{408}</span> three
    hundred years. Now that Rome is no longer the seat of a cosmopolitan theocracy, but
    the capital of a regenerated people; now that Venice joins hands with Genoa,
    forgetful of Curzola and Chioggia; now that Florence and Pisa and Siena stand like
    sisters on the sacred Tuscan soil, while Milan has no strife with Naples, and the
    Alps and sea-waves gird one harmony of cities who have drowned their ancient spites
    in amity,&mdash;the student of the splendid and the bitter past may pause and bow his
    head in gratitude to Heaven and swear that, after all, all things are well.</p>
    <p>X.</p>
    <p>There is no finality in human history. It is folly to believe that any religions,
    any social orders, any scientific hypotheses, are more than provisional, and
    partially possessed of truth. Let us assume that the whole curve of human existence
    on this planet describes a parabola of some twenty millions of years in duration.<a
    name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239"
    class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Of this we have already exhausted unreckoned centuries in
    the evolution of pre-historic man, and perhaps five thousand years in the ages of
    historic records. How much of time remains in front? Through that past period of five
    thousand years preserved for purblind retrospect in records, what changes of opinion,
    what peripeties of empire, may we not observe and ponder! How many theologies,
    cosmological conceptions, polities, moralities, <span class="pagenum"><a
    name="page409" id="page409"></a>{409}</span> dominions, ways of living and of looking
    upon life, have followed one upon another! The space itself is brief; compared with
    the incalculable longevity of the globe, it is but a bare 'scape in oblivion.' And,
    however ephemeral the persistence of humanity may be in this its earthly
    dwelling-place, the conscious past sinks into insignificance before those aeons of
    the conscious future, those on-coming and out-rolling waves of further evolution
    which bear posterity forward. Has any solid gain of man been lost on the stream of
    time to us-ward? We doubt that. Has anything final and conclusive been arrived at? We
    doubt that also. The river broadens, as it bears us on. But the rills from which it
    gathered, and the ocean whereto it tends, are now, as ever in the past, inscrutable.
    It is therefore futile to suppose, at this short stage upon our journey, while the
    infant founts of knowledge are still murmuring to our ears, that any form of faith or
    science has been attained as permanent; that any Pillars of Hercules have been set up
    against the Atlantic Ocean of experience and exploration. Think of that curve of
    possibly twenty million years, and of the five thousand years remembered by humanity!
    How much, how incalculably much longer is the space to be traversed than that which
    we have left behind! It seems, therefore, our truest, as it is our humblest, wisdom
    to live by faith and love. 'And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but
    the greatest of these is charity.' Love <span class="pagenum"><a name="page410"
    id="page410"></a>{410}</span> is the greatest; and against love man has sinned most
    in the short but blood-bedabbled annals of his past. Hope is the virtue from which a
    faithful human being can best afford to abstain, unless hope wait as patient handmaid
    upon faith. Faith is the steadying and sustaining force, holding fast by which each
    one of us dares defy change, and gaze with eyes of curious contemplation on the tide
    which brought us, and is carrying, and will bear us where we see not. 'I know not how
    I came of you and I know not where I go with you; but I know I came well and I shall
    go well.' Man can do no better than live in Eternity's Sunrise, as Blake put it. To
    live in the eternal sunrise of God's presence, ever rising, not yet risen, which will
    never reach its meridian on this globe, seems to be the destiny, as it should also be
    the blessing, of mankind.</p>

      'Finally the Duke decided upon his marriage with Donna Lucrezia d'Este, which took
      place, though little to his taste, for she was old enough to have been his mother.'
      'The Duchess wished to return to Ferrara, where she subsequently chose to remain, a
      resolution which gave no annoyance to her husband; for, as she was unlikely to
      bring him a family, her absence mattered little.' 'February 15, 1598. Heard that
      Madame Lucrezia d'Este, Duchess of Urbino, my wife, died at Ferrara during the
      night of the 11th.' (Dennistoun's <i>Dukes of Urbino</i>, vol. iii. pp. 127, 146,
      156.) Francesco Maria had been attached in Spain to a lady of unsuitable condition,
      and his marriage with Lucrezia was arranged to keep him out of a
      <i>m&eacute;salliance</i>.</p>

      The whole of his elaborate and ingenious theory rests upon the supposition that
      Alfonso at Belriguardo extorted from Tasso an acknowledgment of his <i>liaison</i>
      Leonora, and spared his life on the condition of his playing a fool's part before
      the world. But we have no evidence whatever adequate to support the
      supposition.</p>

      problem of Tasso's misfortunes with the difficulty of having to deal with mutilated
      documents. Still the mere fact that Tasso was allowed to correspond freely with
      friends and patrons, shows that Alfonso dreaded no disclosures, and confirms the
      theory that he only kept Tasso locked up out of harm's way.</p>

      class="label">[51]</span></a> A letter written by Guarini, the old friend, rival
      and constant Court-companion of Tasso at Ferrara, upon the news of his death in
      1595, shows how a man of cold intellect judged his case. 'The death by which Tasso
      has now paid his debt to nature, seems to me like the termination of that death of
      his in this world which only bore the outer semblance of life.' See Casella's
      <i>Pastor Fido</i>, p. xxxii. Guarini means that when Tasso's mind gave way, he had
      really died in his own higher self, and that his actual death was a release.</p>

      Manso's Life (<i>op. cit.</i> pp. 156-176), are the authorities for the symptoms
      detailed above. Tasso so often alludes to his infirmities that it is not needful to
      accumulate citations. I will, however, quote two striking examples. 'Sono infermo
      come soleva, e stanco della infermita, la quale &egrave; <i>non sol malattia del
      corpo ma de la mente</i>' (<i>Lettere</i>, vol. iii. p. 160). 'Io sono poco sano e
      tanto maninconico che <i>sono riputato matto da gli altri e da me stesso</i>'
      (<i>Ib.</i> p. 262).</p>

      Tasso, like his father in similar circumstances, hankered after ecclesiastical

      all spent at Rome. From the Records of the Inquisition, it appears that he arrived
      in Rome on February 27, 1598, and that his trial in form began in February 1599.
      The Pope ratified his sentence of death on January 20, 1600; this was publicly
      promulgated on February 8, and carried into effect on the subsequent 17th. Where

      been raised as to whether Bruno was really burned. But these are finally disposed
      of by a succinct and convincing exposition of the evidence by Mr. R.C. Christie, in
      <i>Macmillan's Magazine</i>, October 1885. In addition to Schoppe and Kepler, we
      have the reference to Bruno's burning published by Mersenne in 1624; but what is
      far more important, the <i>Avviso di Roma</i> for February 19,1600, records this
      event as having occurred upon the preceding Thursday. To Signor Berti's two works,
      <i>Documenti intorno a G. Bruno</i> (Roma, 1880), and <i>Copernico e le
      vicende</i>, etc. (Roma, 1876), we owe most of the material which has been lucidly
      sifted by Mr. R.C. Christie.</p>

      name, in spite of his recantation at Venice; for it seems incredible that he could
      not by concessions have purchased his life. As Breugger wrote with brutal crudity
      to Kepler: 'What profit did he gain by enduring such torments? If there were no God
      to punish crimes, as he believed, could he not have pretended any thing to save his
      life?' We may add that the alternative to death for a relapsed apostate was
      perpetual incarceration; and seven years of prison may well have made Bruno prefer
      death with honor.</p>

      twenty pages in length, when I found that this material would overweight my book. A
      study of Bruno as the great precursor of modern thought in its more poetical and
      widely synthetic speculation must be left for a separate essay. Here I may remark
      that the most faithful and pithily condensed abstract of Bruno's philosophy is
      contained in Goethe's poem <i>Proemium zu Gott und Welt</i>. Yet this poem
      expresses Goethe's thought, and it is doubtful whether Goethe had studied Bruno

      supervision of the Servites that Sarpi gained the first rudiments of education.
      Thirst for knowledge may explain his early entrance into their brotherhood. Like
      Virgil and like Milton, he received among the companions of his youthful studies
      the honorable nickname of 'The Maiden.' Gross conversation, such as lads use, even
      in convents, ceased at his approach. And yet he does not seem to have lost
      influence among his comrades by the purity which marked him out as exceptional.</p>

      correspondence abundantly proves how very grave was the peril of Papal Absolutism
      in his days. The tide had not begun to turn with force against the Jesuit doctrines
      of Papal Supremacy. See Ranke, vol. ii. pp. 4-12, on these doctrines and the
      counter-theories to which they gave rise. We must remember that the Papal power was
      now at the height of its ascension; and Sarpi can be excused for not having
      reckoned on the inevitable decline it suffered during the next century.</p>

      opinion of Hallam and Macaulay, both of whom were convinced that Sarpi was a
      Protestant at heart. Macaulay wishes that he had thrown off the friar's frock. In a
      certain sense Sarpi can be classified with the larger minds among the Reformed
      Churches of his age. But to call him a Protestant who concealed his real faith,
      argues coarseness of perception, incapacity for comprehending any attitude above
      and beyond belligerent Catholicism and Protestantism, or of sympathizing with the
      deeply-religious feelings of one who, after calculating all chances and surveying
      all dogmatic differences, thought that he could serve God as well and his country
      better in that communion which was his by birthright. To an illuminated intellect
      there was not in the seventeenth century much reason to prefer one of the Reformed
      Churches to Catholicism, except for the sake of political freedom. It being
      impossible to change the State-religion in Venice, Sarpi had no inducement to leave
      his country and to pass his life in exile among prejudiced sectarians.</p>

      Superior to the Venetian Senate, printed in the <i>Lettere</i>, vol. ii. pp.
      450-453. It is worth meditating on the contrast between Sarpi's and Bruno's deaths.
      Sarpi died with the consolations of religion on his bed in the convent which had
      been his life-long home. Bruno was burned alive, with eyes averted from the
      crucifix in bitter scorn, after seven and a half years spent in the prisons of the
      Inquisition. Sarpi exhaled his last breath amid sympathizing friends, in the
      service of a grateful country. Bruno panted his death-pangs of suffocation and
      combustion out, surrounded by menacing Dominicans, in the midst of hostile Rome
      celebrating her triumphant jubilee. Sarpi's last thoughts were given to the God of
      Christendom and the Republic. Bruno had no country; the God in whom he trusted at
      that grim hour, was the God within his soul, unrealized, detached by his own reason
      from every Church and every creed.</p>

      illustrated this point by quoting the thirty-five lines in which Titiro compares a
      maiden to the rose which fades upon the spray after the fervors of the noon have
      robbed its freshness (act i. sc. 4). To contest the beauty of the comparison would
      be impossible. Yet when we turn to the two passages in Ariosto (<i>Orl. Fur.</i> i.
      42, 43, and xxiv. 80) on which it has been modeled, we shall perceive how much
      Guarini lost in force by not writing with his eye upon the object or with the
      authenticity of inward vision, but with a self-conscious effort to improve by
      artifices and refinements upon something he has read. See my essay on 'The Pathos
      of the Rose in Time,' April, 1886.</p>

      decorandum</i>, and that he had performed his task with indefatigable pains and
      industry (Baini, <i>op. cit.</i> vol. i. p. 280). But it is noteworthy that of the
      three Masses furnished for the approval of the congregation, the first was entitled

      intercourse with the later survivors of the Bolognese Academy, was able to bequeath
      a vast mass of anecdotical and other material to posterity. The collection contains
      critical annotations and additions by the hand of Zanotti and later art students,
      together with many illustrative documents of the highest value. Reading this

      coloring, the sublimity of Michelangelo, the truth to nature of Titian, the pure

      in art which shows how Malvasia had imbibed Tridentine morality in the middle of
      Italy glowing with Renaissance masterpieces.</p>

      Tintoretto in S. Maria dell'Orto at Venice, and to the Luini in the Monastero
      Maggiore at Milan. Yet the model of Luini's S. Catherine was the infamous Contessa
      di Cellant, who murdered her husband and some lovers, and was beheaded for her
      crimes in Milan. This fact demonstrates the value of the model in the hands of an
      artist capable of using it.</p>

      people of refinement in our own days find a charm in patches, powder, perukes,
      sedan-chairs, patchouli, and other lumber from the age despised by Keats. I
      remember visiting a noble English lady at her country seat. We drank tea in her
      room, decorated by a fashionable 'Queen Anne' artist. She told us that the quaintly
      pretty furniture of the last century which adorned it had recently been brought
      down from the attic, whither her fore bears had consigned it as
      tasteless&mdash;Gillow in their minds superseding Chippendale.</p>
